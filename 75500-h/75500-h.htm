<h2>Chapter I. <br> 8:37 <i>p. m.</i>—Spring 3100</h2>

<p>Mrs. Endicott thought for a moment of simply
dialling the operator and saying, “I want a
policeman.”</p>

<p>It was what the printed notices in the telephone
directory urged one to do in case of an emergency.
But it wasn’t an emergency exactly, nor—still
exactly—was it a policeman she wanted. She wanted
a detective, or an inspector, or something; a man to
whom she could explain her worry about Herbert,
and who could do something about it if he agreed
with her that Herbert was in danger.</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott had never had any personal contact
with the police. Whenever she thought about it at all
she thought of the force as an efficient piece of
machinery, the active parts of which one observed daily
from one’s motor as healthy and generally good-looking
young men who controlled traffic. She knew
that there was a patrolman whose beat carried him
past their door. Upon thinking suddenly about it she
realized that she had only seen this man twice or
three times at most during the past year. She knew
that Herbert always left a ten-dollar gold piece to be
given him by one of the maids at Christmas, and a
check for twenty dollars as a subscription to some
enterprise vaguely designated as the “fund.”</p>

<p>She wondered momentarily whether the police
characters she had seen in various plays, while at the
theatre with Herbert, were true to life. Most of the
characters had been brutal, in spite of a pleasant
tender-heartedness reluctantly betrayed toward the
final curtain, and just at present she wanted quiet,
competent understanding—not brutality.</p>

<p>It occurred to her that a private investigator might
be better, but she was uncertain as to the extent of
their official powers. She decided to rely on the police,
because the police could do something if they agreed
with her that something ought to be done.</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott looked up the telephone number of
police headquarters and dialled Spring 3100. She
grew nervous while waiting.</p>

<p>“This is Mrs. Herbert Endicott speaking,” she
said, when an undeniably masculine voice answered.
It was an impersonal, efficient voice with no
overtones about it. “Will you please connect me with
your detective department? . . . I beg your pardon?
Oh.” She gave the number of her house on East
Sixty-third Street between Fifth and Madison
avenues.</p>

<p>“This is Mrs. Herbert Endicott speaking,” she
began again, upon a second voice’s saying, “Hello,”
“and I am worried about Mr. Endicott. I wonder
whether you could send someone up to talk it over
with me. . . . No, he hasn’t disappeared. I know
exactly where he has gone, but I have reason to believe
that something might happen to him. . . . Yes, it’s
the Mr. Endicott who has been in the papers recently
in connection with Wall Street. . . . Around in a few
minutes? But I thought police headquarters were
down on Centre Street. . . . They transferred the call
to the precinct station? Really. . . . Oh, thank you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott replaced the receiver on its hook.
She felt distinctly impressed at the efficiency with
which her request had been so instantly transferred
to the place where it could be handled competently
and with dispatch.</p>

<p>The living room where she had been telephoning
was on the second floor of the house. She left it and
went to her dressing room, which was toward the
rear of a corridor on the same floor. She gave her
appearance a preoccupied inspection before a pier
glass. The soft and uneven lines of the jade chiffon
of her dress would offer a satisfactory mask, she felt,
for the nervous tenseness of her body. She renewed
the red on her upper lip where she had been biting it.
She returned to the living room, lighted a cigarette,
and picked up a novel which she did not read.</p>

<p>She smoked three cigarettes.</p>

<p>Her sense of aloneness became stifling. The conceit
grew upon her nervous condition that she had
changed places with the furniture. She had become
inanimate and the furniture endowed with attributes
of life, as if her being were under the influence of some
dispassionate regard by something that had no eyes
with which to see. It was nonsense—nonsense. She
never should have listened—at least not attentively—to
that wretched old woman. She could very well
just have given the appearance . . . one had to be
polite . . .</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott moved restlessly to one of the draped
windows and stared down on the silent street. About
her stretched the city of New York, and yet her
environment could not have been quieter in some cabin
in the woods. Not as quiet. Her memory swerved
to that hellish week with Herbert in the forests
outside of Copenhagen . . . what on earth <em>was</em> the name
of that little watering place . . . Trollhättan? . . .
No, that was in Sweden. Names never mattered. She
looked up for a while at a slender slice of night sky
horizoned by cornices across the street. It was heavy
with stars that held her as if they were so many
magic mediums arranged in heaven for the express
purpose of granting her earthbound wishes. Wishes?
She shrugged. She released the drapes, and they
settled into place.</p>

<p>A maid opened the living-room door and came in.</p>

<p>“A lieutenant from the precinct station, madam.”</p>

<p>“All right, Jane. Ask him to come up here. Did he
give his name?”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Valcour, madam, I think he said.”</p>

<p>“Try and be more careful in the future about
getting names.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott lighted another cigarette. Her sense
of having done the proper thing began to desert her
in a rush. The police had a habit of finding things
out—unexpected things, irrelevant to any matter on
hand. She was sure of it, and wondered on what she
based the knowledge: books, hearsay. She would have
to be careful, but after all, a person with
intelligence—— He was standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>“My maid,” she said, “wasn’t sure of your name.
Is it Valcour?” She noticed with a sense of relief that
he was not in uniform and that he had left his hat and
overcoat downstairs. Mrs. Endicott had an aversion
to discussing things which fringed on possible
intimacies with people who were hatted and coated.
He was a mild elderly man with features that were
homely but not undistinguished, well dressed in
tweed, and not smoking a cigar. He affected her with
a quieting sense of reassurance.</p>

<p>“Valcour is correct, Mrs. Endicott. I happened to
be leaving for home when your call was put in, so
I stopped in personally instead of sending a detective
as you suggested.”</p>

<p>The faint trace of cultured precision in his speech
made her suspect foreign origin. She was sensitive to
voices, and while not exactly collecting them, they
almost amounted with her to a hobby. They were
an essential part in the attraction she felt toward
certain people, and it would have been within the
bounds of possibility for her to have fallen in love
with a voice.</p>

<p>“You are of French origin, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“French-Canadian, Mrs. Endicott. I became
naturalized twenty years ago.”</p>

<p>She offered her hand. They sat down. Now that he
was here she felt that the necessity for hurry had
vanished; his air of official protection had erased it.
She wondered how it would be best to begin: just
where to plunge into the foggy mass that composed
her worry.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour accepted a cigarette and lighted
it. He was agreeably impressed with Mrs. Endicott
and with the room. Both were unusual, and the
competent foundation in culture he had acquired at
McGill University in his youth enabled him to place
them at a proper evaluation. The furniture was low
set in design and severely simple, the general effect
one of spaciousness and repose oddly marred by a
muted undernote of harshness. It was not bizarre.
He suspected it, correctly, of being modernistic. Mrs.
Endicott herself had the startlingly clear perfection
of features one occasionally finds in blondes. He
decided that her age centred on twenty-five. Beneath
her authentic beauty—her face seemed planed in pale
tones of pink ice—there would be a definite substrata
of metal. He noted that the six cigarette butts crushed
in the vermilion lacquered tray on a small table beside
her chair had not been smoked beyond a few puffs
each. A clock standing on the broad-shelved mantel
of the fireplace struck nine.</p>

<p>“My husband,” Mrs. Endicott said abruptly, “has
been gone now exactly two hours.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour smiled amiably and settled
himself a little less formally in his chair. His manner
presented itself to her as a freshly sponged slate upon
which she could trace any markings that she might
choose.</p>

<p>“He left here at seven o’clock this evening,” Mrs.
Endicott said, “to go to the apartment of a woman
with whom he thinks he is in love. Her name is Marge
Myles, and her apartment is on the Drive.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour’s smile seemed to offer both
consolation and an apology.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there isn’t very much we can do for
you,” he said. “It’s always private inquiry agents
who handle work of that—well, of that rather delicate
character.”</p>

<p>“No—I haven’t made myself plain.” Mrs. Endicott’s
indeterminate thoughts began to crystallize.
“I’m not looking for evidence to secure a divorce.
This woman is nothing of any permanence, but I’m
afraid of her—of what she might do to Herbert.”
Then she added, as if the simple statement in itself
would insure his comprehension, “You see, I’ve seen
her.”</p>

<p>“With him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. They were lunching at the St. Regis. Herbert
always was a fool about those things. She’s
foreign-looking—the Latin type.” Mrs. Endicott felt the
need for being meticulously explicit. “Her eyes are
like the black holes you see in portraits of Spanish
women. They’re the entire face; everything else blurs
into a nonessential whiteness. This woman’s eyes are
like that—like weapons. I know she’s the sort who
would kill if she got stirred up over something—got
jealous or something. People do get jealous enough to
kill,” she ended.</p>

<p>“Frequently.” Lieutenant Valcour stored away
in his memory the broken nail on the little finger of
Mrs. Endicott’s left hand. The uniform perfection of
detail in the rest of her appearance made it stand out
jarringly. “This is all most unfortunate,” he said
sympathetically, “but I still doubt whether there is
anything we could do. If there were only something
definite—say a threat, for example—we’d be very
glad to investigate it and to offer Mr. Endicott
suitable protection.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott stood up. The abruptness of the
movement spread the folds of chiffon that streamed
from a bow on her left shoulder, and Lieutenant
Valcour’s deceptively indifferent eyes lingered on
bruise marks that showed blue smears upon white
skin before the chiffon fell back into place.</p>

<p>“Would you come with me to my husband’s
room?” Mrs. Endicott said.</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“There’s something there I’d like to show
you—to ask you what you think about it.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour followed Mrs. Endicott along
the corridor that led past her dressing room. A door
beyond this opened into her bedroom, and directly
across the corridor from it was the door to Endicott’s
room. The blank end of the corridor served as a wall
for the bathroom, which connected the two bedrooms
and turned them into a suite which ran the width of
the rear of the house.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour sensed a difference in the
furnishings of Endicott’s bedroom that set it at sharp
variance with the other parts of the house that he
had seen. It was done in heavy mahoganies that were
antiquated rather than antique, and methodically
centred in each panel of its gray-toned walls was a
print of some painting by Maxfield Parrish. After a
comprehensive glance around he felt as if he had
already met Endicott. He had at least evolved a
fairly accurate portrait of the man’s sensibilities, if
not of his physique. He thought that Endicott would
be difficult: a clearly divided neighbouring of the
physical and the ideal, assuredly conscious of the
fitness of things—which would be responsible for his
acquiescence in the tone of the rest of the house—but
dominated by an inner stubbornness which faced
ridicule in the maintaining of his private room at the
level he had accepted as a standard years before.</p>

<p>“That is his desk.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott indicated a flat-topped desk which
was placed before one of the rear windows. A
lemon-jacketed book with crumpled pages was lying on it
as if it had been slammed there. Near the book was
a scrap of paper. Lieutenant Valcour leaned down
and stared at the paper without picking it up. On it
was printed in pencil:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/scrap.png"
       alt="Scrawled capital letters reading “BY THURSDAY OR—”.">
</figure>

<p>He looked at Mrs. Endicott. She was evidently
waiting for him to speak.</p>

<p>“To-day is Thursday,” he said. “Might it not be
simply a memorandum?”</p>

<p>“My husband doesn’t print his memorandums, nor
is it likely he would use a piece of paper torn from a
paper bag.” She added, to clinch her belief, “I can’t
imagine Herbert ever having a paper bag.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he bought something at some
haberdasher’s.”</p>

<p>“The paper is too cheap. It’s more like the sort
they use at grocers’ or small stationers’.”</p>

<p>“So it is.”</p>

<p>“And there’s a crudeness about the printing. It’s
almost an intentional crudeness.” Mrs. Endicott
stared fixedly at Lieutenant Valcour. “It’s the sort
of printing you’d expect to find in a threat,” she said.</p>

<p>“I have learned to find almost any sort of writing
or material used for purposes of conveying a threat,”
Lieutenant Valcour said. “People who threaten are
invariably unbalanced emotionally, if not actually
mentally, and there is never any telling just what they
will do. There was a case that recently came to my
attention where a woman received a threat which
had been engraved on excellent paper and enclosed
in the conventional inner envelope one uses for formal
announcements or invitations.”</p>

<p>“Really.”</p>

<p>“I’m not, by that, questioning your judgment in
the matter of this note, Mrs. Endicott. It might quite
well be a threat, as you think.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing else apparent that it could be.”</p>

<p>“When did you find it, Mrs. Endicott?”</p>

<p>“After my husband had left.”</p>

<p>“Lying just about where it is now?”</p>

<p>“Exactly where it is now.”</p>

<p>“I see. You didn’t touch it then—just read it. I
wonder why your husband left it there.”</p>

<p>She looked at him almost impatiently. “I don’t
imagine he did leave it there—that is, purposely. It
probably fell out from between the leaves when he
slammed the book down.”</p>

<p>“Has it occurred to you that we might call up this
Marge Myles—but that’s foolish. Of course you’d
have thought of that.”</p>

<p>He observed her obliquely as she answered.</p>

<p>“He’d never forgive me.” Her gesture was faintly
expressive of helplessness. “I’m not supposed to
know anything about it.”</p>

<p>“Of course. This menace, Mrs. Endicott, this
danger that you are fearing, where do you think it
lies?”</p>

<p>She became consciously vague. “The
streets—indoors—out——”</p>

<p>“And you’re basing it entirely upon this note?”</p>

<p>“Primarily. It’s something concrete, at any rate.
I think that he ought to have protection, and yet, if
I did do anything about it, he’d put it down as
spying.”</p>

<p>“Well, if this note is a threat there is rarely only
one, you know. I wonder whether we might find any
others. I haven’t the remotest justification for
looking, but I’m willing to do so if you wish me to.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott grew curiously detached. “His papers
are in the upper right-hand drawer,” she said.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour opened the drawer. Its contents
were in a state of considerable confusion. It
was not the sort of confusion which is the result of a
cumulative addition of separate notes, letters, and
sheets of paper, but a kind that exists when a
normally orderly collection of papers has been milled
around in suddenly.</p>

<p>“There’s quite a mass of stuff here,” he said. “It
might be simpler to eliminate other possible places
before tackling it. I must repeat again that I’ll be
exceeding any legal rights by doing so, but if you
earnestly believe your husband is in danger I’d like
to go through the pockets of his clothing.”</p>

<p>“Pockets?”</p>

<p>“It’s a much more usual place to find important
things than you would imagine.”</p>

<p>“His clothes are in that cupboard.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott indicated a door. Lieutenant Valcour
went over and opened it. An electric light was
automatically turned on in the ceiling. The large
hulk of a man crumpled into one corner of the
cupboard gave him a severe shock. The man was dead.
He closed the door and faced Mrs. Endicott. He
nodded toward the desk, on which a telephone was
standing.</p>

<p>“I’m going to use that telephone for a few minutes,”
he said. “There’s a message I want to put through.
Also, please ring for your maid.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott’s eyes widened a little. “There’s
something in the cupboard,” she said.</p>

<p>“Ring for your maid, please.”</p>

<p>She went past him and toward the cupboard door.
He shrugged. The value of her reaction would offset
the brutality of not stopping her. She opened the door
and looked in. Her grip tightened on the knob.</p>

<p>“Then he didn’t go out at seven,” she said.</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Endicott. He didn’t go out at all.”</p>

<h2>Chapter II. <br> 9:24 p. m.—Hall Marks of Murder</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour felt that the utter stillness of
the room would overwhelm him. He—Mrs. Endicott—everything
seemed to be taking its cue from death.
He reached past Mrs. Endicott and touched the
body’s cheek. It was quite cold.</p>

<p>“Where is your room, Mrs. Endicott?”</p>

<p>He carefully pried her fingers from the knob of the
cupboard door and then closed it.</p>

<p>“But you can’t leave him in that cupboard.”</p>

<p>Her voice held the toneless qualities of arrested
emotion, as if the functioning of her nerve centres
had stopped.</p>

<p>“We must leave him in there, Mrs. Endicott,
until someone from the medical examiner’s office has
seen him. If you’ll tell me the name of your family
physician before you lie down——”</p>

<p>“Lie down—I? Lie down?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and rest. I’ll call the doctor up on the
possible chance that we’re mistaken, only I’m quite
certain, Mrs. Endicott, that we aren’t.”</p>

<p>She stumbled verbally in her rush. “Worth—Dr.
Sanford Worth—Calumet 876—it’s 876 something—I
know it perfectly well. I—it’s in my
book—come with me.”</p>

<p>She seemed mechanically vitalized, and her movements
were those of a nervous, jerky toy. She flung
open a door adjacent to the cupboard. It led into a
bathroom, the fittings of which were of coral-coloured
porcelain. A door in the opposite wall led into her
bedroom. She went immediately to a leather reference
book beside a telephone near her bed.</p>

<p>“It’s Calumet 8769,” she said.</p>

<p>Her finger slipped in the dialling. Lieutenant
Valcour gently took the instrument from her hands
and put through the call.</p>

<p>“The office of Dr. Worth?” he said, when a
woman’s voice answered him. “This is the home of
Mr. Herbert Endicott. I am Lieutenant Valcour of
the police department. Mr. Endicott is dead. I would
appreciate it if Dr. Worth would come here at once
and consult with the medical examiner, and also
attend to Mrs. Endicott. Thank you.” He replaced the
receiver.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest intention of collapsing,
Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“We will need Dr. Worth anyway, Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour dialled the Central Office and,
in a suddenly most efficient voice, gave the requisite
information. He then called his own precinct station
and told the sergeant at the desk to send over a detail
of five men in uniform.</p>

<p>“The chief of the Homicide Bureau, the medical
examiner, and some of my own men will be here
presently,” he said to Mrs. Endicott.</p>

<p>“And my husband has to stay in that cupboard
until they come?”</p>

<p>“Unless Dr. Worth arrives first and disagrees
with me that Mr. Endicott is dead.”</p>

<p>“It’s inhuman.”</p>

<p>“Very, but there’s a set routine for these cases
that we have to observe. Is this the button you ring
for your maid?”</p>

<p>He pressed a push button set in the wall at the
head of the bed.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t want her.”</p>

<p>“You may, and there’s no harm in her being with
you. I’m going to leave you in here for a little while,
until the people we’ve telephoned for come.”</p>

<p>“You insist on my staying in this room?”</p>

<p>“Heavens, no. Do anything you like, Mrs. Endicott,
or that you feel will help you. As long,” he added
gently, “as you don’t leave the house.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“You see we’ll have to talk such a lot of things
over, just as soon as the usual formalities are
finished.”</p>

<p>“It’s rather terrible, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Pretty terrible, Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>“So”—she mentally groped for a satisfactory
word—“so conclusive.”</p>

<p>It seemed a peculiar choice. Lieutenant Valcour
sensed that it wasn’t just Endicott’s life alone which
was concluded by death, but something else as well—such
as an argument, perhaps, or a secret and bitter
struggle. The precise significance was elusive, and he
gave it up, or rather checked it within his memory
in that compartment which already contained six
barely smoked cigarette butts, a broken finger nail,
bruise marks, and a note which, in view of the body,
might safely be presumed to have been a threat.</p>

<p>A maid knocked on the door and came in. She
stared speculatively for a curious second at
Lieutenant Valcour.</p>

<p>“Madam rang?”</p>

<p>“No, Roberts. Lieutenant Valcour rang.
Lieutenant Valcour is of the police.”</p>

<p>Any sudden announcing of the police is always
shocking. It is a prelude to so many unpleasant
possibilities even in the lives of the most blameless.
They are in a class with telegrams. Lieutenant
Valcour noted that Roberts accepted his identity with
nothing further than an almost imperceptible catching
of breath. Mrs. Endicott’s attitude puzzled him.
It wasn’t resentment, certainly, or any stretching at
rudeness; such emotions seemed so utterly
inconsequential at this moment when she must have been
wrenched by a very severe shock. It reminded him of
the aimless play of lightning clowning before the
purposeful fury of a storm.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Endicott will explain things to you,” he
said. “Stay with her, please.”</p>

<p>There lingered, as he went into the bathroom, a
picture of the two women, separated by the distance
of the room, standing quite still and staring at each
other: Mrs. Endicott, young, exquisitely lovely
looking—the other, older, quite implacable. The
connection was absurd, but the effect remained of
two antagonists in a strange encounter who are
standing in their separate corners of a ring. He closed
the bathroom door and slipped the catch. He turned
on all the lights.</p>

<p>There was a single window. He parted muslin
curtains and looked at a glazed lemon-coloured shade,
especially along its hemmed bottom. There were some
smudges at its centre that interested him. He believed
that they had been made by a dirty thumb. He raised
the shade and the lower sash of the window.</p>

<p>The night was clear and cold and windless. A
shallow stone balcony ran the width of the rear of
the house. It was for ornamentation rather than use,
as to get onto it one had to straddle the window sill.
Lieutenant Valcour did so, and stood looking down
upon the dimly defined outlines of what, in spring,
would bloom into a formal garden. He satisfied himself
that there seemed no access to the balcony from
the ground unless one used a ladder or were endowed
with those special and fortunately rare qualities which
transform an otherwise normal person into a human
fly.</p>

<p>The house was five windows wide; the two on the
right of the bathroom belonged to Mrs. Endicott’s
room, and the two on its left to her husband’s. He
flashed on his electric torch and examined all five
sills. None showed a trace of recent passage, and
there was no very good reason, he realized, why any
of them should. They were clean, windswept, and
smooth.</p>

<p>How pleasant it would be, he reflected, to come
across the perfect imprint of a shoe, or a rubber,
or—what was it that was so popular at the moment?—of
course: the footprint of a gorilla. The case would
then be what was technically known as an open-and-shut
one. He’d simply take the train for California
and arrest Lon Chaney, and—— But enough.</p>

<p>And the floor itself on the balcony was smugly
lacking in clues. He relinquished the keen sharp air,
the star-heavy night, and returned to the bathroom
by way of its window, which he closed, and again drew
down its lemon-coloured shade.</p>

<p>A cake of soap in a container set in the wall above
a basin attracted his attention. It was so incredibly
dirty. Someone with exceptionally dirty hands had
used it and either hadn’t bothered to rinse it off or
else hadn’t had the time to. The dirt had dried on it.</p>

<p>He couldn’t vision such a condition of uncleanliness
in connection with the hands of either Mr. or
Mrs. Endicott, unless there had been some obscure
reason. He preferred to think for the moment that
the hands had belonged, and presumably still did, to
the murderer. That, of course, eliminated the gorilla.
What a pity it was, he reflected, that he was so
constantly obsessed with infernal absurdities. Even
though he tried to keep them under triple lock and
key when working with his associates on the force,
they had a distressing habit at times of cropping out
into the open where they could be seen. Nor were
they of a humour especially in vogue among his
contemporaries; there rarely was an
and-the-drummer-said-to-Mabel or an-Irishman-and-a-Jew among them.
Rarely? He shuddered. Never. As a result there were
occasions when he rested under the cloud of being
considered mildly lunatic. It was bad business. He
had told himself so firmly again and again. Success
and humour formed bedfellows as agreeable as an
absent-minded dog would be <i>en négligé</i> in the boudoir
of a surprised cat.</p>

<p>With a beautiful access of gravity he lifted the lid
of an enamelled wicker hamper and peered in at the
soiled linen it contained. There were many towels.
Towels were, he reflected, one of the few genuine hall
marks of the rich. The Endicotts, hence, must be
very, very rich, as it was obvious that they shed—or
was it shedded?—towels as profusely as the petals
fall from a white flowering tree.</p>

<p>There was a badly soiled and crumpled towel on
the very top of the pile. He picked it up and looked
at it. It was very dirty and still faintly damp. He
folded it, set it on the floor beneath the basin, and
placed the cake of soap upon it. They were, he smiled
faintly, Exhibits B and C. The distinction of being
classified as Exhibit A was already reserved by the
threatening note on the desk. As for the smudges on
the lemon-coloured shade, they would have to be
definitely determined as finger prints before they
could have their niche in the alphabet. The prosecuting
attorney would be pleased. He was a man whose
flair for alphabeted exhibits amounted to a passion.
Lieutenant Valcour hoped that he could find a
crushed rose. The prosecuting attorney was at his
best with crushed roses. For example, take that
knifing case in the Ghetto. Three petals were all the
prosecuting attorney had had there, but they had
bloomed, via the jury, into tears. Into tears,
Lieutenant Valcour amended, and tripe.</p>

<p>A pair of silver-backed brushes showed no finger
marks upon their shining surfaces, nor were there any
on the silver rim that backed a comb. One could infer,
Lieutenant Valcour decided, and did, that someone
later than Mr. Endicott had used them, as Mr.
Endicott would never have wiped them off to remove
his prints, and had he not done so there certainly
would have been some signs of usage. What a careful
murderer it was, he thought, to polish the evidence
so very clean. And what a grip the subject of finger
prints maintained upon the criminal mind, and upon
the lay mind as well. It seemed to embrace their
Alpha and Omega in the scientific detection of crime.
Lieutenant Valcour offered to bet himself his last
nickel that the murderer had overlooked entirely the
possibility of what might be found left within the
bristles of the brushes and between the teeth of the
comb. He took a clean hand towel from the rack and
wrapped the brushes and the comb up in it. He set
the bundle on the floor beside the cake of soap and
the dirty towel. The alphabet, he reflected, had now
been depleted down to F.</p>

<p>The bathroom could tell him nothing more. He
reconstructed its segment of the drama before leaving
it: the murderer had entered, gone at once to the
window and pulled down its shade. There had been a
washing of hands and a brushing and combing of hair.
The murderer had wiped the silver clear of finger
prints and had left. The whys and wherefors must
come later. The shell would remain unchanged until
the moment came to pour it full of motive and give
it reason and life.</p>

<p>He went into Endicott’s room and opened the
cupboard door. The beam from his electric torch,
added to the ceiling light, brought out sharply the
waxy pallor of the face’s skin. Its good-looking,
homely ruggedness was marred by a slight cast of
petulance, as inappropriate as a pink bow on a lion.
Cruelty showed, too, a little—and something inscrutable
that baffled analysis. Endicott weighed, Lieutenant
Valcour decided, close upon two hundred pounds
and no fat, either; a strong, powerfully muscled
man, and about thirty-five years old. He played the
light upon Endicott’s right hand and exposed the
wrist a little by drawing up the sleeve. The wrist and
hand were normally clean, as he had expected.</p>

<p>He gently inserted his fingers into such of Endicott’s
pockets as he could reach without disturbing
the body. From the rumpled state of their linings
and their complete emptiness it was apparent that
they had been hastily turned inside out and replaced.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour began to sniff at a motive.
Not robbery, exactly, in the ordinary sense, as an
expensive platinum wrist watch and a set of black
pearl shirt studs were untouched, but robbery in the
extraordinary sense—one that had been indulged in
for a certain definite purpose. He strongly began to
suspect that there would be the ubiquitous “fatal
papers.” It might also develop that Endicott was
the secretive owner of some fabulous jewel of a sort
usually referred to as a Heart of Buddha, or perhaps
some important slice of the Russian crown
jewels—the number of which now almost equalled, he
reflected, the thousands upon thousands of ancestors
who came over to our shores on the <i>Mayflower</i>.</p>

<p>The top button was missing from Endicott’s
overcoat. It would have been torn away when the
murderer had lifted his victim from the floor in order
to drag him into the cupboard. Otherwise there wasn’t
anything that hinted at a struggle. There wasn’t
any blood, or any wound, or sign of contusion visible
on the head, and no trace of blood around such parts
of the cupboard that Lieutenant Valcour could see.</p>

<p>He suddenly wondered where Endicott’s hat was.
It wasn’t on Endicott’s head, nor in the cupboard,
nor in the bedroom, which struck him as strange.
He was a strong believer in the paraphrase that where
the coat is, there the hat lies, too. One could look for
it more carefully later. Just at present, of greater
importance was Exhibit A.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour went to the desk, picked up
the note and studied it. The pencil used had been a
thick leaded one, almost a crayon. And there, right
before his nose in a shallow tray that held an assortment
of office things, was a pencil with a very thick
lead that was almost a crayon. He copied the note
with it on the back of an envelope he took from his
pocket. He compared the result with the printing on
the note. They were alike.</p>

<p>One begins, he informed himself gently, to wonder.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch03">

<h2>Chapter III. <br> 9:45 p. m.—Guards Are Stationed at the Doors</h2>

<p>There are knocks, Lieutenant Valcour believed, and
knocks. He ranged them from gentle careless rappings,
through sly sinister taps, to imperative demands
and, finally, thumps. He classified the ones at
the moment being bestowed upon the hall door as
official whacks. He was right. He put the scrap of
paper and the crayon pencil in his pocket and turned
to greet five men from the station house who flooded
into the room on the heels of his “Come in.”</p>

<p>They were intelligent-looking young men, well
built, alert, and their uniforms were immaculate—five
competent blue jays outlined sharply against
gray walls. Lieutenant Valcour knew each one of
them both by reputation and by name.</p>

<p>He nodded to the starchiest and youngest looking
of them. “Cassidy,” he said, “stay in here. O’Brian,
stay by the front door, and keep Hansen with you to
carry messages. There’s a servants’ entrance at the
front, McGinnis. It’s yours. And you, Stump, watch
the door from the back of the house into the garden.
If anyone wants to leave the house send him to me
first. You can let anyone in, with the exception of
reporters, and find out their business. Now in regard
to the reporters just be your natural genial selves
and say that apart from the plain statement that
Mr. Herbert Endicott, the owner of this house, is
dead and that—” Lieutenant Valcour choked
slightly—“foul play is suspected, you can tell them
nothing. The police, as usual, are actively on the job,
have the case well in hand, and there is every reason
to believe that in view of our customary efficiency
the guilty parties will soon be brilliantly apprehended
etcetera and so forth Amen. Excuse-it-please.”</p>

<p>“Cuckoo,” confided O’Brian to Hansen as, with
Stump and McGinnis, they filed out.</p>

<p>“Cuckoo as a fox,” agreed Hansen, who had
worked under Lieutenant Valcour on a case before.</p>

<p>“Yeh?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour and young Cassidy were alone.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Cassidy, how are the servants taking all
this, if you bumped into any of them?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I only saw the girl at the front door,
Lieutenant. She’s a sorry piece, and was shivering
worse than one of them new and indecent dances.”</p>

<p>“Did she say anything?”</p>

<p>“She did not, beyond telling us to follow her
upstairs. She took us to that door across the hallway
first, and some lady said you was in here.”</p>

<p>“How did that lady’s voice sound to you,
Cassidy?”</p>

<p>“Smooth, sir.”</p>

<p>“Not nervous?”</p>

<p>“Devil a bit.”</p>

<p>“What are you looking for, Cassidy?”</p>

<p>“The corpse, sir.”</p>

<p>“It’s in that cupboard.”</p>

<p>“Is it now?” said Cassidy, casually removing
himself as far from the cupboard door as he could.
“It ain’t one of them Western hammer murders, is
it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what kind of a homicide it is,
Cassidy. There are no marks on him that I can see.”</p>

<p>“Will it be poison, then?”</p>

<p>“Maybe.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s hope it’s one or the other. I hate them
mystery cases where the deceased got his go-by from
a Chinese blow gun, or some imported snake from
Timbuctu, or parts adjacent.”</p>

<p>“When did you ever work on such a case,
Cassidy?”</p>

<p>“Sure, Lieutenant, you can read about them every
week in the magazines. There’s one that’s in its
fourth part now where some louse of foreign extraction
kills a dumb cluck of a Wall Street magnet with
a package of paper matches, the tips of which was so
fixed that they exploded when struck, instead of
acting decent like, and shot dabs of poison into the
skin of his fingers. Can you imagine it? Just say the
word and I’ll bring it around to the station house and
you can read it for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Cassidy.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be no trouble at all, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>An important knock on the door disclosed a
stranger. Lieutenant Valcour addressed him,
correctly, as Dr. Worth.</p>

<p>Dr. Sanforth Worth did not merely imagine that
he cut a distinguished figure; he was sure of it. A
certain grayness clung impressively about the
temples of an intellectual brow, and he was probably
one of the few physicians left in New York who had
both the audacity and ability to wear a Vandyke.
He was dressed in evening clothes and had not
bothered to remove his overcoat or to give up his hat.</p>

<p>“Dr. Worth? I am Lieutenant Valcour, of the
police. Mr. Endicott is in here.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth bowed gravely, and with a sparklingly
manicured hand stroked his Vandyke once. “I
have been afraid of something like this for quite a
while, Lieutenant,” he said. His voice, in company
with everything else about him, sounded expensive.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour raised his eyebrows. “It
begins to seem, Doctor, as if everybody except Mr.
Endicott himself anticipated his murder.”</p>

<p>“Murder?”</p>

<p>It was Dr. Worth’s eyebrows’ turn. They raised.
They fell. They became, in conjunction with pursed
lips, judicious. He removed his overcoat and placed
it, with his hat, upon a chair.</p>

<p>“I believe you will find, Lieutenant, that it is just
his heart. His—— Dear God in heaven, man, what
have you left him slumped down like this for?”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t touch him, Doctor, unless you think
he isn’t dead.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth stiffened perceptibly. “Fancy that,”
he said. “Well, one would infer that he is dead, all
right. Just the same, Lieutenant, is there any legal
objection to opening his coat and shirt bosom? I
dare say I could slit them, if you preferred. You see,
it might be advisable to test for any trace of heart
action with the stethoscope.”</p>

<p>“I had no intention of offending you, Doctor.
Go right ahead and do anything you think is
absolutely essential to establish life or death.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth melted conservatively. “You see, sir,
I know his heart. He had a nervous breakdown two
years ago which left its action impaired.” He loosened
Endicott’s overcoat and the black pearl studs set in
a semi-soft shirt bosom. He listened for a moment,
and then removed the stethoscope. “No trace,”
he said. “He’s dead. Shall I button up the shirt front
and the coat again?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t necessary, Doctor.”</p>

<p>The hall door opened abruptly. The homicide chief
and the medical examiner came in, followed by a
squad of detectives. Lieutenant Valcour was well
acquainted with both officials. He introduced them
to Dr. Worth and placed at their disposal such
information as he had gained while waiting for them to
arrive.</p>

<p>The department’s experts automatically began to
function at once. A photographer was already
arranging his apparatus to make pictures of the body
from as many angles as its position in the cupboard
would permit. A finger-print man went about his
duties along the lines laid down by established
routine. The medical examiner and Dr. Worth
gravitated naturally together and plunged into a
discussion of Endicott’s medical history.</p>

<p>The homicide chief, a well-built, alert-looking man
of fifty, by the name of Andrews, drew Lieutenant
Valcour a little to one side.</p>

<p>“What do you really make of it, Valcour?” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s undoubtedly murder, Chief, but I doubt
whether there’ll even be an indictment unless we get
a lucky break, establish a definite motive, and get a
confession.”</p>

<p>“I feel that way about it, too. Any signs of an
entry having been forced?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t looked. I’ve been in here all the time,
and my men just came.”</p>

<p>“Well, Stevens and Larraby are making the rounds
now. They’ll let us know. If the autopsy doesn’t
show poison or some wound it’ll be a nuisance. If
it’s a straight heart attack, as Dr. Worth claims, we
might just as well drop it. Can you imagine getting up
before a jury that’s been shown a picture by the
defense of a big husky like Endicott and saying, ‘This
man was scared to his death?’ Suppose a woman
was the defendant. They’d laugh the case out of
court.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it won’t be as bad as all that, Chief. While
you’re busy in here I’ll wander around and try to
scare up something. Would you mind sending for me
when the medical examiner reaches some decision as
to the manner of death?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing, Valcour. I’ll see to it, too, that those
brushes and comb are looked into.”</p>

<p>“I’ll probably be in Mrs. Endicott’s room. That’s
the door just across the corridor.”</p>

<p>Andrews was aware of Lieutenant Valcour’s reputation
in the department for the painless extraction
of useful information from people. “Go to it,” he
said. “And squeeze every drop that you can.”</p>

<h2>Chapter IV. <br> 10:02 p. m.—Pale Flares the Darkness</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour wondered concerning Mrs.
Endicott as he walked slowly across the corridor and
knocked on the door of her room. A curious, curious
woman, with youth and beauty that almost passed
belief. He knew her instinctively as one of life’s
misfits: complex to a note far beyond the common tune;
essentially an individualist; essentially unhappy from
an inevitable loneliness which is the lot of all who
are banished within the narrow confines of their own
complexity; a type he had seldom met, but of whose
existence he was well aware.</p>

<p>Roberts opened the door. The woman’s face was
butchered and her eyes had the quality of glass.</p>

<p>“Ask Mrs. Endicott, please, whether she feels
strong enough to see me for a moment.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott’s voice was definitely metallic. As
it reached him in the corridor, disembodied from any
visual association with herself, it seemed to hold a
muted echo of brass bells.</p>

<p>“Certainly, come in. I wish, Lieutenant, you
would give up the tiresome fiction that I am going to
collapse. I’ll ring, Roberts, when I want you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p>As Roberts passed him on her way to the door
Lieutenant Valcour felt an imperative awareness of
an attempt at revelations—an attempt to impart to
him some special knowledge. Her eyes, as she glanced
at him, lost their cobwebs and grew sharply informative.
It was entirely an unconscious reaction on his
part that forced from his lips the word “Later.”
The cobwebs reappeared. She left the room.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour drew a chair close to the
<i>chaise longue</i> upon which Mrs. Endicott was
nervously lying. Flung across her knees was a robe
of China silk, a black river bearing on its surface
huge flowers done in silver and slashed at its fringes
with the jade chiffon of her dress. He launched his
campaign by first swinging, wordily, well wide of its
ultimate objective. His tone, from a deliberate casual
friendliness, was an anodyne to possible reservations,
or fears.</p>

<p>“It is the tragedy of a detective’s life,” he said
pleasantly, “that the sudden slender contact he
has with a case affords such a useless background for
human behaviour. You can see what I mean, Mrs.
Endicott. Were I you, or some intimate friend either
of yourself or of your husband, I would already be in
possession of the countless little threads that have
woven the pattern of Mr. Endicott’s life for the
past five or ten years. You’ll forgive me for outraging
oratory? It’s a nasty habit I’ve contracted in later
years whenever dealing with the abstract. I’m not
making a speech, really. What I’m trying to express
is that in that background, that pattern of Mr.
Endicott’s life, one thread or series of interrelated
threads would stand out pretty plainly as the reason
why someone should wish to kill him.”</p>

<p>“I,” said Mrs. Endicott, “have several times
wished to kill him.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour nodded. “There is nothing
left for me but the trite things to say about marriage.
And trite things, after all, are the true things, don’t
you think?”</p>

<p>“If they’re just discovered. I mean by that, that
to the person just discovering their deadly aptness
they’re true. Rather terribly so sometimes.”</p>

<p>“But the aptness wears off with usage?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott’s slender hand and arm were models
of quietness in motion as she reached for a cigarette.
“Everything wears off with usage,” she said. “Love
quicker than anything else.”</p>

<p>“But it doesn’t wear off completely, love doesn’t,
ever.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott looked at him sharply. “Why are
you a detective?” she said.</p>

<p>“The accident of birth—of environment. Only
geniuses, you know, ever quite escape those two
fatalities. My parents emigrated from France to
Canada, where my father held a certain reputation
in my present profession. My parents died. There
was enough money to secure an education at McGill—one
had contacts here in the States . . .” Lieutenant
Valcour smiled infectiously. “I reversed Cæsar
in that I came, was seen, was conquered.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott was amused. “How utterly
conceited.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The smile vanished from her face with the peculiar
suddenness of some conjuring trick. She veered
abruptly. “What are they doing in my husband’s
room now?” she said.</p>

<p>“Dr. Worth and the medical examiner are determining
the cause of death.” Lieutenant Valcour transferred
his attention to a Sargent water colour above
the mantel. “Dr. Worth has already expressed the
opinion that it was heart failure,” he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott offered no immediate comment.
She withdrew, for a moment, into some private
chamber, and her voice was rather expressionless
when she spoke. “But that isn’t murder.”</p>

<p>“It could be—if the disease itself were used as a
weapon.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that I understand.”</p>

<p>“Why, if some person who knew that Mr. Endicott
was subject to heart attacks were deliberately to
shock or scare him suddenly, or even give him a
not especially forceful blow over the heart, and he
were to die as a result of any one of those things,
that would be murder. It would have to be proved
pretty conclusively, of course, that it had been done
deliberately.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott joined him in his continued inspection
of the Sargent. “It would indicate a rather
circumscribed field for suspects, too, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Yes. One would confine one’s suspicions to
those who were intimate enough with him to know
of his physical condition. But apart from all that
phase, there are those things we technically speak of
as ‘attendant circumstances.’ They point to murder.”</p>

<p>Their glances brushed for a second in passing and
then parted.</p>

<p>“Such as?”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour explained, with certain reservations.
“The note you showed me—the position of Mr.
Endicott in the cupboard—the fact that he is
completely dressed for out of doors, but there is no
trace of his hat—oh, several little things that speak
quite plainly.” He focussed her directly. “Where
did Mr. Endicott usually keep his hats?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never noticed particularly. There’s a cupboard
downstairs in the entrance hall, and of course
the one——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve looked for it up here. I wonder whether
you’d care to tell me what happened—what you did,
I mean, and what you remember of Mr. Endicott’s
movements from the time, say, of his reaching home
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott’s face sought refuge in the very
pith of candour. “Why, nothing much—nothing
unusual.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour laughed pleasantly. “That
is where I fail in my background,” he said. “The
things done were usual to both of you and therefore
of no importance. To me, however, they would prove
interesting because of their unfamiliarity. Did you
talk at all?”</p>

<p>“Elaborately.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>

<p>“I said elaborately. Herbert makes a point of
talking elaborately whenever he’s lying.”</p>

<p>“I see—he was lying, then, about Marge Myles.”</p>

<p>“And unoriginally. But Herbert never was original,
much, in his emotions. He told me he was going to
an impromptu reunion of some men in his class at
the Yale Club. These reunions have occurred with
astonishing regularity once a week for the past
month, in spite of their impromptu character. I
detest having my intelligence insulted,” she ended,
not unfiercely, “more than anything else in the
world.”</p>

<p>“You will forgive me for becoming personal, but
I doubt whether Mr. Endicott understood you very
well.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t understand me at all.”</p>

<p>“And you, him?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott momentarily disarranged the perfect
arch of her eyebrows. “I could see through him
perfectly,” she said. “A child could see through him.
But understand him? I don’t think anyone could
understand Herbert. He made a fetish of reticence.
He was,” she concluded, “half animal.”</p>

<p>“And the other half rather cloudily complex?”</p>

<p>“A fog.”</p>

<p>“And when he came home this afternoon at five?”</p>

<p>“Five-thirty—nearer six, even.”</p>

<p>“Toward six, he joined you in the living room and
gave you the weekly excuse.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say the living room. It was the top
floor—you may have noticed that this house has a peaked
roof—in what would correspond in the country
to an attic——” She stopped sharply, and her
defensive veneer cracked for an instant, long enough
to show that she was definitely startled. “I——”</p>

<p>“You feel that you shouldn’t have told me that.
Perhaps you shouldn’t. If the fact of your having
met Mr. Endicott in the attic has nothing to do with
the case at all, it will cause us to snoop around
among your personal affairs unnecessarily.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t ‘meet’ me there, as you say. He—I
don’t know why he came up there. I never will know
why.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t ask him?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott forced Lieutenant Valcour’s full
attention by the almost startling intentness of her
eyes. “There has never been a direct question
put or answered between Herbert and me during the
whole period of our married or unmarried life,” she
said. “My hold on him was the static perfection of
my features and a running, superficial smartness in
attitude and mind that passed for intellect. His hold
on me was that I loved him.”</p>

<p>“Even when you wished to kill him?”</p>

<p>“I suppose even then. Mind you, I never wished
him <em>dead</em>—there’s a difference.”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite.” Lieutenant Valcour smiled engagingly.
“You often felt like killing him, but you
wanted it to stop right there.”</p>

<p>“You know, I wish you’d come to tea sometime——”
Mrs. Endicott’s eyes contracted sharply. Her
voice became a definite apology, not to Lieutenant
Valcour, but as though its message were being sent
along obscure and private channels to some port
where it would find her husband. “There are
moments,” she said, “when you make me forget.”</p>

<p>“Forgetting isn’t a sin. That’s natural. It’s not
loving—being mentally hurtful—that’s a sin. There
isn’t any word exactly for what I mean. Did you
both stay in the attic and go through the trunk
together, or whatever it was you were going through?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott smiled as if at some secret knowledge.
“I wasn’t going through a trunk,” she said.</p>

<p>“No? I just mentioned it, as nine times out of ten
that’s what people do in attics.”</p>

<p>“And the tenth customary thing,” said Mrs.
Endicott, reaching for a cigarette, “is suicide.”</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch05">

<h2>Chapter V. <br> 10:17 p. m.—Living or Dead?</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour’s eyes narrowed slightly.
He had a habit of dividing suicides into two classes—those
who talked about killing themselves, and those
who did so. He knew that the two rarely overlapped.
He felt a shocking conviction that in Mrs. Endicott’s
case she might well have been the exception which
proved the rule. “I suppose an attic is the conventional
place for suicide,” he said. “Or at least to think
about it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott’s laugh was without humour. “One
doesn’t need an attic in order to think about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. And so you went downstairs with
him, then?”</p>

<p>“He followed me in here. That is,” she corrected
herself with noticeable carelessness, “we went into
the living room and he wondered, while he kissed me,
whether I’d mind very much being alone for dinner.
I doubt whether you’ve ever experienced, Lieutenant,
the rather perfect torture of a, well, an abstract kiss.
Men don’t.”</p>

<p>“We’re too self-centred, I’m afraid, or conceited
or something, or else our sensibilities aren’t refined
enough to be hurt by it.”</p>

<p>“But you could understand—if you could vision
the background?”</p>

<p>“Everybody knows what love is, Mrs.
Endicott.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it—it’s the comparison of what is
with what has been. It’s an indescribably vulgar
subject—kissing—but it’s either very wonderful or
very painful. People who claim it can be a combination
talk nonsense. We can eliminate, of course——”</p>

<p>“Of course—‘petting’ they call it, or did. You never
know from one minute to the next just what a thing
is being called. And then he went to his room to
dress?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Alone?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Has he a valet?”</p>

<p>“Herbert? Heavens, no.”</p>

<p>“And you dressed?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Roberts helped you?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Then when Mr. Endicott said good-bye?”</p>

<p>“He called it through the closed door.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour almost visibly showed his
surprise. “He did say good-bye?”</p>

<p>“Herbert insists upon saying good-bye. He rapped
on the door and called in. If it would interest you to
know his exact words,” she said bitterly, “they were
in the falsetto voice he uses when he thinks he’s being
especially funny and were, ‘Don’t be angry with
Herbie-werbie, sweetheart. Goodie-byskie.’ ”</p>

<p>“They’re almost a motive in themselves,” said
Lieutenant Valcour, smiling. “Which door did he
rap on, Mrs. Endicott?”</p>

<p>“The hall door.”</p>

<p>“I see. And you heard him going down the stairs?”</p>

<p>“One can’t hear footsteps with the door closed.”</p>

<p>“And that was at——?”</p>

<p>“The clock over there on my mantel was striking
seven.”</p>

<p>“And after that there is nothing further you can
tell me about Mr. Endicott?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“You dined. You went to his room. You found
the note. You began to worry, and then you called
us up.”</p>

<p>“That is it.”</p>

<p>“Was it in this room here or up in the attic, Mrs.
Endicott, that you told him you were going to kill
him?”</p>

<p>“Here, after he—— That wasn’t exactly fair,
was it?”</p>

<p>“Heavens no, but awfully smart.” Lieutenant
Valcour’s smile was the essence of pleasantness. “I
do wish you’d continue with the ‘after he.’ After he
did what? Or was it something he said?”</p>

<p>“Did.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I told you,” she blazed, “that he was half animal.
You can hardly expect me to become more explicit.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour was genuinely upset. “I do
beg your pardon, Mrs. Endicott,” he said. “About
this afternoon, were you in the house?”</p>

<p>“Partly. I had tea at the Ritz, early, about
four-thirty—with,” she added defiantly, “a man.”</p>

<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>“Exactly so. That will permit you to reverse
another tradition and go <i>cherchez l’homme</i>.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour found instant good humour.
“So you decided to fight fire with fire,” he said.</p>

<p>“If you care to call it that.”</p>

<p>“Just who is Marge Myles, and what?”
Lieutenant Valcour said suddenly.</p>

<p>“There are several terms one might apply to her.
They all mean the same thing. I believe that recently,
however,” Mrs. Endicott said very distinctly,
“she has lost her amateur standing.”</p>

<p>“Recently?”</p>

<p>“The past year or so.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Endicott had known her as long as that?”</p>

<p>“Until the past month or two my husband had
not known her at all. He’d heard of her, of course, and
so had I.”</p>

<p>“Then she is a woman who once had position?”</p>

<p>“She was the wife of one of Herbert’s friends, a
man who died two years ago and left her penniless.
They say, incidentally, that she killed him.”</p>

<p>“Killed him?”</p>

<p>“It was just gossip, of course. They had a camp
near some obscure lake up in Maine. The canoe
they were in one evening upset. Harry Myles couldn’t
swim.”</p>

<p>“And Marge Myles?”</p>

<p>“Marge Myles was famous for her swimming.”</p>

<p>“Then the inference is that she, well, neglected to
save her husband?”</p>

<p>“That—and that she deliberately upset the canoe.
I repeat it’s all gossip. People dropped him, you
see, after he married her. That’s a commentary for
you.”</p>

<p>“You mean they still accepted him while he
was—that is, before the ceremony.”</p>

<p>“Yes, while he was living with her. It’s thoroughly
natural, of course. People didn’t have to recognize
her then; they could ignore her. But you can’t ignore
a man’s wife; you either have to recognize her or not.
The nots had it. If she had been a genuinely nice
person, or an amusing one, I doubt whether the
fact of their having lived together really would have
mattered. But she wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“What was she before her marriage?”</p>

<p>“A member of that much-maligned group known
as the chorus.”</p>

<p>“And recently she had got in touch with your
husband?”</p>

<p>“She looked up all of Harry’s old friends. Don’t
you see? As a widow she again had a standing—a
shade higher, but similar to the one she held
before Harry married her. I don’t know how many
others she landed, but she certainly landed
Herbert.”</p>

<p>“And you were afraid she would do something
to him?”</p>

<p>“Well, she killed Harry.”</p>

<p>“Then you personally believe the gossip?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott did not bother to give a direct reply.
She shrugged, and twisted a little on the <i>chaise
longue</i>.</p>

<p>“And do you associate her in any way, Mrs.
Endicott, with what has happened here to-night?”</p>

<p>She continued to evade further direct responsibility
for an opinion. “Who else?” she said.</p>

<p>“But the actual mechanics of it, Mrs.
Endicott—how could she have got into the house?”</p>

<p>“It could be done. Herbert himself might have
let her in.”</p>

<p>“That’s going a little far, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was rotten of me to suggest it. I never
really thought it, Lieutenant. I just said it.”</p>

<p>“And after all, Mrs. Endicott, why should she want
to kill your husband? You weren’t trying to keep him
from her.”</p>

<p>“He might have been trying to keep himself from
her.”</p>

<p>“He might. It’s stretching it a little, though, to
think she’d deliberately kill him for that.”</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t do it deliberately.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. When a woman starts out to kill
she invariably chooses some weapon, or a poison.
Every case has proved it again and again. But we’re
only speculating, aren’t we? Who was it who took you
to tea?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any intention of telling you.”</p>

<p>“Because it might involve him?”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t possibly be involved. If I thought
he were I’d tell you in a minute.”</p>

<p>Someone knocked on the door.</p>

<p>“Just the same, Mrs. Endicott, I wish you would
tell me who he was.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour was able not only to recognize
finality, he could accept it. He considered Mrs.
Endicott’s very definite refusal to answer his
question as of small consequence; there were so many
more ways than one for frying an eel. He stood up
and crossed to the door. He opened it and stepped into
the corridor, closing the door behind him. Even in
the dimmish light young Cassidy’s normally ruddy
face was the colour of chalk.</p>

<p>“What’s happened, Cassidy?”</p>

<p>“Honest to God, Lieutenant, I’m scared stiff.
They’re getting things ready in there to bring that
corpse back to life.”</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch06">

<h2>Chapter VI. <br> 10:32 p. m.—Pictures in Dust</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour stared for a puzzled instant
at the white face.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Cassidy?” he said.</p>

<p>“Honest to God, Lieutenant, I mean just what
I say.”</p>

<p>“But that’s impossible.”</p>

<p>Cassidy went even further. “It’s sacrilege,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” Lieutenant Valcour said sharply.
“You have simply misunderstood Dr. Worth. It is
possible that Mr. Endicott was not dead at all but
in some state of catalepsy. No one, Cassidy, can bring
back the dead.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear you say so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then let us go in.”</p>

<p>“Must I go back in there, too?”</p>

<p>“You must. Forget the fact that you’re a superstitious
Irishman, Cassidy, and remember that you’re
a cop. Cops, as you’ve been told more times than
one, should be noble, firm, and perpetually cool,
calm, and collected.”</p>

<p>“Sure now, you’re kidding.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut.”</p>

<p>“Well, and I’ll try, Lieutenant—but cripes!”</p>

<p>“But nothing,” advised Lieutenant Valcour as he
opened the door to Endicott’s room.</p>

<p>The effect was shockingly garish. All shades had
been removed from their lamps, and the various details
of the furnishing stood out in the painful white
light brightly clear.</p>

<p>Andrews was alone. He stood near the bed upon
which Endicott had been placed, looking in rather
shocked bewilderment at the body. Lieutenant
Valcour joined him. A blanket had been drawn up to
Endicott’s chin, and the face which remained exposed
looked very waxlike—very still—very much like a
dead man’s indeed.</p>

<p>“This is the damnedest thing, Valcour.”</p>

<p>“What is, Chief?”</p>

<p>“They say there’s a chance that this man isn’t
dead. Worth is going to operate.”</p>

<p>“Operate? But Dr. Worth himself admitted that
the heart had stopped beating after testing with a
stethoscope. What sort of an operation?”</p>

<p>“Worth’s going to inject adrenaline into the
cardiac muscles.”</p>

<p>“I wonder just how much value there is in that
stuff.”</p>

<p>“Well, unless Endicott’s been poisoned, the medical
examiner and Worth both seem to think there’s
a chance. They feel there’s no harm in trying,
anyway. It sounds silly to me, but they reminded me of
that recent case in Queens—you probably read about
it—where a man had been pronounced dead for six
hours and was revived. Of course, they said he wasn’t
really dead, just as they now think that Endicott
may not be really dead. No one can bring back the
dead.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour threw a bland look to Cassidy,
who was standing in as convenient a position to the
hall door as he could possibly get.</p>

<p>“They say,” Andrews went on, “that adrenaline’s
been used off and on for years. Worth says they try
it quite often when a baby is born ‘dead.’ Sometimes
it starts the heart pumping and the baby lives.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour shrugged. “It will make
things pretty simple for us if it works with Endicott,”
he said. “He can make a statement and prefer charges
himself. Where is everybody?”</p>

<p>“The medical examiner and Worth are downstairs
telephoning and making arrangements for the
operation. My men have finished and have gone back to
headquarters. There wasn’t any sign of forcing an
entry, so it looks like an inside job, if there was any
job. I tell you, Valcour, if it wasn’t for your suggestion
that robbery was a motive, or for that note that
might have been a threat, I’d drop the whole thing.
It’s a different matter if the adrenaline doesn’t work
and an autopsy proves poison or something. Find out
much from Mrs. Endicott?”</p>

<p>“Enough to be interested in learning more. Want
the details?”</p>

<p>“Later, if I have to get to work on the case. You
want to keep on handling it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead. Call for any outside stuff you want us
to check up on for you. I’ll send you a report on the
brushes and comb as soon as they finish with them
downtown.”</p>

<p>“You going, Chief?”</p>

<p>“No use in my sticking around, Valcour. We
haven’t a case yet, really, that calls for any Central
Office work. Hell, according to those two six-syllable
specialists downstairs, we haven’t even got a corpse.
Robbery there may have been, and it’s your precinct—so
go to it. I’ll find out from the medical examiner
when he gets back how the operation turned out,
and if there’s going to be an autopsy. If poisoning
is proved and you haven’t pinned it on anyone by
then, I’ll get on the job again. I suppose you’ll see
that the people in the house are given the
once-over?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Chief.”</p>

<p>“I’ll run along then. Good luck, Valcour.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Chief.”</p>

<p>Andrews left the room and closed the door.</p>

<p>“I bet he’s got a date,” said Cassidy.</p>

<p>“He’d stay here if he had twenty dates, if he
thought it was necessary,” said Lieutenant Valcour.</p>

<p>“Well, I wish I had a date.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have a whole vacation if you don’t brace
up. I’m going to take a look in that cupboard, now
that Endicott’s no longer in it.”</p>

<p>Even a cupboard seemed preferable to Cassidy to
being in the room. “Can’t I help you, sir?” he said
with almost fervent politeness.</p>

<p>“No, Cassidy, you can’t. You can stay just where
you are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, sir.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour picked up a straight-backed
chair and took it into the cupboard with him. He
held a sincere respect for the Central Office men, but
at the same time felt that their work was too methodically
routine to permit their darting along interesting
tangents or wasting their time in strolls along
bypaths that might lead to fertile fields. There was no
criticism in his mind at all. He admired the system
that had been established, and the expert functioning
of its units and departments. He knew very well that
its average of successes was greater than its average
of failures. But it was deficient in that elusive,
time-taking, and sometimes expensive thing known as
the “personal equation.” It remained, at its best, a
machine.</p>

<p>A certain amount of carelessness, too, ran in the
general plan. In many cases some things were slurred
over, some missed entirely. This again was not
surprising when one considered that the personnel was
recruited largely from the more intelligent men in the
ranks. Intelligent, yes, but hardly specialists, nor
could one in all fairness expect them to be.</p>

<p>When working on a case they functioned along
two distinctly separate but parallel lines. One
department of specialists handled the technical and
chemical investigation of material things and clues found
on the scene of the crime—just as the brushes and
comb were shortly to be examined by the proper men
down at Central Office. A second department dealt
with the human aspect—examining witnesses, looking
up all friends or connections of the victim; a
large, competent organization that would stretch
feelers, no matter how many were necessary, to every
contact point of the victim’s life within the city, and
from whose findings some possible motive could be
established and some possible suspect or group of
suspects be evolved.</p>

<p>The two branches would then compare notes, and
if a satisfactory amount of evidence had been
obtained by the technical department to establish a
case against one or several of the suspects, arrests
would be made or the suspects brought in for
questioning. According to the temperament and station
of the suspects, one of the various forms that go to
make up the properly dreaded third degree would be
employed and a confession obtained. The work of
the Central Office would then be finished, and the
case up to the prosecutor.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour was glad that in the present
instance the homicide chief had felt it useless to set
in motion the machinery of the second branch until
more definite developments should occur. The case
interested him. Mrs. Endicott interested him—her
astonishing beauty, her mind, her
contradictions—Roberts—Marge Myles—three women who offered
an assurance of satisfying an almost blatant curiosity
he possessed for discovering the source springs of
human behaviour. This talk about reviving Endicott
and Endicott himself making a statement—well,
perhaps. But until it was accomplished he preferred
to think of Endicott as a corpse, the case a definite
homicide, and of possible suspects right in the house.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour concentrated his attention
upon the cupboard. There were shelves along the
back of it, the lowest one being at the height of a
man’s head. Numerous suits of clothes were hanging
from beneath this lowest shelf. He stood on the chair
and played his flashlight along the top of it. There
was nothing there but an accumulation of dust. He
felt a distinct and highly satisfactory thrill when he
noted that streaks showed where the dust had very
recently been rubbed away, as if somebody had
deliberately wiped both his hands in it. It linked
with the dirty cake of soap. Andrews had said
nothing about the streaks. It was pretty obvious that
the Central Office men had overlooked them—had
casually observed that the shelves were empty and
had let the matter go at that.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour began to feel quite pleasant
and informed himself gravely that a deduction was
in order. For a happy moment he considered the
possibility of that curious and sinister Oriental
influence that crops up so perennially in the very
finest of murder cases—of Cassidy’s murder cases:
that elusive figure swathed in gray, whitely turbanned
above coffee-coloured skin, who has a penchant
toward religious fanaticism the esoteric rites of which
involve dust. This breath-shocking villain would
ultimately be trapped by the bright detective through
the wretch’s occult passion for this dust. Had one,
Lieutenant Valcour wanted to know, such an
enigma to deal with here? No, he informed himself
sternly, one knew damned well one had not. But
in the place of such a handy and beautiful
deduction—what?</p>

<p>He stared at the dust and began to see pictures in
it: a crouching person tormented by hate or fear,
or both, who knows that Endicott is going to open
the cupboard door. What, in the name of the lighter
humorists, to do? The person dreads recognition. Is
there no disguise? No, curse it—but yes—the dust!
The person’s hands are smeared, and by means of
the hands, the face . . .</p>

<p>“Ain’t there <em>nothing</em> I can do for you, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour sighed and got down from the
chair.</p>

<p>“Yes, Cassidy,” he said. “You can take this chair
and put it over by the hall door. Then you can sit
down.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Lieutenant,” said Cassidy bitterly.
“But when you’re in that cupboard there ain’t
nobody in the room with me but that live corpse.”</p>

<p>“Then sit where you can’t see it.”</p>

<p>“Cripes, Lieutenant, I don’t <em>have</em> to see it. I get
the chills just thinking about it.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get the gate, Cassidy, if you don’t snap
out of it.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir, but if you come out and find me
keeled over, don’t blame me.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t dream of it, Cassidy.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour reëntered the cupboard. He
examined the corner in which Endicott had been
slumped. The suits on the hangers had fallen back a
little into shape. He carefully went through their
various pockets. They were empty, and from the
rumpled condition of their linings he knew that they
had been hastily gone through before. Perhaps the
Central Office men had done so, but he doubted it.
They would concern themselves pretty exclusively
with the effects taken from the clothes Endicott had
been wearing at the time of the attack.</p>

<p>It interested him to note that the suits against
which Endicott’s body had been slumped showed
evidence of having been searched with the rest. It
confirmed his theory that that was what the attacker
had been doing when caught in the cupboard by
Endicott’s sudden appearance in the bedroom, and it
also strengthened his theory of the ingenious use of
dust from the shelf top as a disguise.</p>

<p>Shoes lined a low shelf along the bottom of one
side, and hat boxes occupied a corresponding shelf
on the other. Lieutenant Valcour dismissed the
possibility that the particular hat he was searching
for—the one that Endicott was wearing or intended to get
at the moment of the attack—would be in a box.
Perhaps it was in the cupboard Mrs. Endicott
spoke about downstairs in the entrance hall. The
point kept nagging at him irritatingly, and he
considered it important enough to go down and find out.</p>

<p>Cassidy barely restrained himself from clutching
Lieutenant Valcour’s arm by the hall door.</p>

<p>“Honest to God, you ain’t going to leave me in here
alone, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Honest to God, Cassidy, I am.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour went out. Cassidy took one
bleak look at his charge, the living corpse, carefully
crossed the fingers of both his hands, and sat down.</p>

<p>“I just knew,” he muttered truculently, “that this
case was going to be one of them printed damn things.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch07">

<h2>Chapter VII. <br> 11:01 p. m.—Banked Fires</h2>

<p>The corridor was deserted.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour walked along it to the top of
the stair well and looked down into the entrance hall.
He could see the broad athletic back of Officer
O’Brian on guard at the door. O’Brian’s snub nose
was pressed against the plate glass, and his eyes, one
presumed, were staring out through the door’s bronze
grille upon the street.</p>

<p>As Lieutenant Valcour went down he wondered at
the complete stillness of the house. There was no
sound of any nature at all. There was a waiting
quality about the stillness: a definite waiting for
something that would shatter the hush into
bedlam.</p>

<p>“What are you pressing your nose against the
glass for, O’Brian?” he said.</p>

<p>The young policeman turned and grinned at him
broadly.</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s them boys from the papers, sir,” he
said. “They’re all stirred up over what the medical
examiner has just told them.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour groaned faintly. “When was
this, O’Brian?”</p>

<p>“Not two whisks of a lamb’s tail ago, sir—out
there in the vestibule.”</p>

<p>“Did the medical examiner go out into the
vestibule?”</p>

<p>“He did that, Lieutenant, and the last mother’s
son of them has just beaten it off down the street like
a jumping jack rabbit. They were crazy after
photographs, but he drew the line at that now.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Lieutenant Valcour was politely
astounded.</p>

<p>“Sure and he did—with the exception of a flash or
two he let them take of himself.”</p>

<p>“And were you the little birdie, O’Brian?”</p>

<p>“Was I the which, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Did you say ‘peet-tweet’ over his left shoulder as
the flashlights went off?”</p>

<p>“Ah, sure now, sir, and I did have the door open a
wee bit. I was just explaining to the boys that they
couldn’t come in without your permission nohow,
and it was then that the medical examiner came
along and, hearing the talking, went outside to
pacify them.”</p>

<p>“A modern martyr throwing himself to the lions.
Except for the tea party, O’Brian, has anything
happened down here?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing, sir.”</p>

<p>“Any of the servants been drifting around?”</p>

<p>“Only one old dame in black, and seven foot
tall if she’s one inch. She came halfway down the
stairs, took one dirty look at me, and then stalked
back up as stiff as a poker. Her bonnet was on her
head.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know who she was, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“That and I don’t, sir. She looked like she might
be a housekeeper.”</p>

<p>“She probably was. By the way, O’Brian, just
what was it the medical examiner told the boys?”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, I could make neither the head nor
the tail out of it. I’d been telling them myself that
the boss upstairs was dead and that foul play was
suspected, and they were hot after the medical
examiner for a further word, and I’m damned if he
didn’t give it to them.”</p>

<p>“What was the word, O’Brian?”</p>

<p>“Indeed and it sounded like crinoline, sir—the stuff
the missus do be talking about in old dresses.”</p>

<p>“Was that all he said?”</p>

<p>“It was enough, sir. ‘Crinoline,’ said he, and
looked very wise at that. Then he added, ‘For the
present, boys, no more,’ and off they scampered like
the devil in person was after them.”</p>

<p>“All right, O’Brian. Just stick where you are.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour wandered around the entrance
hall but encountered, beyond his own and the
medical examiner’s, no hat. He knew that Dr.
Worth’s was still upstairs where the doctor had left
it in Endicott’s bedroom. He found the cupboard
Mrs. Endicott had referred to. There was no hat.
The subject was becoming a fixed idea. It was
growing increasingly believable that the attacker had
taken the hat and worn it out of the house. But why
should the attacker leave the house? And what
was the matter with the attacker’s own hat? Time,
if not Endicott himself, would have to tell.</p>

<p>From a reception room opening off the entrance
hall he caught the murmur of Dr. Worth’s and the
medical examiner’s voices in consultation. He passed
the door indifferently and went upstairs.</p>

<p>. . . an old dame in black, seven foot tall if she was
an inch. Her bonnet was on her head.</p>

<p>. . . and her bonnet, Lieutenant Valcour repeated
softly to himself, was on her head.</p>

<p>He continued on up a second flight of stairs to the
third floor. A door toward the end of the hall was
open, and light flooded out through the doorway.
He walked to it and looked in.</p>

<p>A tall, thin woman sat on a chair before a grate in
which some coals burned bleakly. She was
unbelievably gaunt—her silhouette a pencil, rigidly
supporting an austere face beneath a smooth inverted
cup of steel gray hair. Black taffeta sheathed
her, tightly pressing against flat narrow planes, and
smoothly surfacing two pipelike arms that ended in
the tapering, sensitive hands of an emotional ascetic.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour rapped on the door jamb.</p>

<p>The woman did not start. Her head alone turned
and faced him, and her eyes were a contradiction of
nature—black planets glowing coldly in a sky of
white.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, I am Lieutenant Valcour of the
police. Are you, by any chance, the housekeeper?”</p>

<p>Her voice was of New England—low almost to
huskiness, a trifle harsh, and completely stripped of
all nuances.</p>

<p>“Yes, Lieutenant. I am Mrs. Siddons.”</p>

<p>“May I come in? Thank you—please don’t get up.
I’ll only stay a minute or two, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>He took a chair and placed it before the fireplace
beside her own. He sat down and did nothing beyond
observing obliquely for a moment the curiously
artificial placidity of Mrs. Siddons’s clasped hands.</p>

<p>“There is no use in questioning me, Lieutenant,
because I have nothing to say.”</p>

<p>Her tone was the chill clear winds that sweep the
rigorous mountains of Vermont.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour warmed his hands before the
lazy coals and smiled amiably. “And I,” he said,
“have absolutely nothing to ask.”</p>

<p>“That is a lie.”</p>

<p>There was nothing abusive in the remark. It
was simply a statement of fact, coldly, dispassionately
pronounced by the remarkable pencil dressed
in black who spired beside him. Lieutenant Valcour
was shocked into a nervous laugh. He discarded his
mask of indifference and stared at Mrs. Siddons
openly and with complete interest. Not planets, her
eyes—rather were they banked fires beneath whose
ash hot coals smouldered deeply.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” he said, “but that your
forbears came from Salem.”</p>

<p>A look of interest stirred sleepily in the coals.</p>

<p>“Why so, sir?”</p>

<p>“Because there’s a look of witch-burning in your
eyes.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Siddons gestured a slow negation.</p>

<p>“I would never abrogate the rights of God.”</p>

<p>“But you would approve, Mrs. Siddons.”</p>

<p>“I would <em>rejoice</em>, sir, in the crushing out of any
evil or”—her tone became implacably stern—“of
any evil thing.”</p>

<p>“Or even of a human being?”</p>

<p>Her look did not waver.</p>

<p>“Yes, Lieutenant—or even of a human being.”
She went on steadily and unemotionally. Her words
were fragments of stone chipped from some elemental
quarry of granitelike conviction and harsh purpose.
“That is why you find me dry-eyed, sir, in spite of
the tragedy which has been visited upon this house.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour felt that there was a catch in it
somewhere. If she held Endicott’s condition in the
light of a tragedy then she scarcely regarded his
death as an act of vengeance on the part of her
unquestionably inflexible god.</p>

<p>“Tragedy?” he repeated softly.</p>

<p>“A tragedy, sir, for blinded eyes.”</p>

<p>He hoped that she wasn’t going to be allegorical.
He endeavoured to interpret. “It is hard on Mrs.
Endicott,” he said.</p>

<p>For a moment he thought she was going to melt.
“That poor young thing,” she said, and her voice
fringed on unaccustomed softnesses. “That sweet
young child of beauty—what a bitter ending for the
journey of her tormented heart.”</p>

<p>He stepped delicately out upon the fragile ice.
“But she’s really better off, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“She will never know to the full the fortune of her
release.” Mrs. Siddons’s incredibly thin body was
suddenly shaken with passion as she added, “From
that hateful—that filthy beast.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Mrs. Siddons—no man is quite as bad
as all that.”</p>

<p>Her eyes blazed with the heat of a strange malevolence.
“You didn’t know him, Lieutenant, as we did.”</p>

<p>“ ‘We,’ Mrs. Siddons?”</p>

<p>“Myself, sir, and the servants under my charge.”</p>

<p>“You found him disagreeable—overbearing?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Siddons stared fixedly at the coals, as if
finding in their vibrant reds some adequate illustration
of her angered thoughts. “I found him such a
man, Lieutenant, that I am glad to know that he
is dead.”</p>

<p>“But you see, Mrs. Siddons, he isn’t dead.”</p>

<p>He thought for a minute that she was going to
faint and instinctively leaned forward to support her.
She stood up unsteadily but refused the offer of his
hands.</p>

<p>“If you will pardon me, sir, I believe I will lie
down. There has naturally been a certain
strain—a——”</p>

<p>She bowed and found her way to a door that
led into an inner room. Lieutenant Valcour listened
for a moment at its panels after she had closed it.</p>

<p>He could not determine whether the muffled sound
he heard was of peculiar laughter or a sob.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch08">

<h2>Chapter VIII. <br> 11:28 p. m.—Mrs. Endicott Screams</h2>

<p>The tangents and the bypaths were beginning to
increase. Lieutenant Valcour tabulated them as
he went thoughtfully down the stairs and along the
corridor toward Endicott’s room: Mrs. Endicott
herself, and the Spartan Mrs. Siddons—both had
been partially explored; Roberts, with her astonishing
glance that had hinted so definitely at revelations.
Then what of Marge Myles? And what of the
unknown man with whom Mrs. Endicott, that afternoon,
had taken tea? He opened the door to
Endicott’s room and went in.</p>

<p>Preparations for the operation were practically
complete. Dr. Worth and the medical examiner were
beside the bed, and hovering near them were two
trained nurses in uniform—middle-aged, competent
women, starched and abstract looking, moving a bit
aloofly in their private world which was so concisely
separated from the sphere of laymen.</p>

<p>Cassidy, who seemed bleaker than ever, still
stiffly occupied the chair near the doorway. He
continued to inspect with an almost feverish interest an
unsullied expanse of white ceiling above his head.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour seated himself on the corner of
a long mahogany chest that was placed before the
window farthest from the bed and gravely watched
Dr. Worth. He began to feel a little sickish and
hoped that he wasn’t going to make an ass of himself
and faint. He had witnessed any number of accidents
and stabbings, but had never been present at an
operation, and it worked on his nerves. Even if
Endicott weren’t dead, he certainly looked it.
Suspended animation and catalepsy were all right as
figures of speech, but the human illustration was
rather ghastly. Lieutenant Valcour felt justified in
believing that he knew his corpses. He wondered why
Dr. Worth was delaying—hesitating—no, bending
over now, and in his hand, ready to give the injection
of adrenaline into the cardiac muscles, was . . .</p>

<p>The response was immediate.</p>

<p>With the aid of the stethoscope Dr. Worth heard
Endicott’s heart throbbing again, growing steadily
stronger. Quite noticeably beneath the bright white
lights a faint flush started to run through Endicott’s
skin. Lieutenant Valcour saw it, and he moistened
with his tongue the dry pressed surface of his lips.</p>

<p>Dr. Worth straightened up and handed the stethoscope
to the medical examiner. “Endicott lives,”
he said.</p>

<p>No one had noticed Mrs. Endicott standing in the
doorway. No one had even noticed that the door
was open. It was her terrific scream, her dropping to
the floor, that shocked everyone into instant
awareness of her presence. Dr. Worth nodded to one of
the nurses. With her aid he lifted Mrs. Endicott
and carried her from the room. Everyone else remained
quite literally spellbound, still chained within
the influence of that extraordinary scream. It didn’t
seem more than a second or two before Dr. Worth
returned. He went directly to Lieutenant Valcour.</p>

<p>“I have given Mrs. Endicott a narcotic that will
keep her quiet for the night,” he said. “It was
outrageous—her being here. That guard at the door
should have seen to it that it was kept closed.”</p>

<p>“Most outrageous, Dr. Worth. I believe all of us
were hypnotized by watching you.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t care what the law is, she can’t be
questioned or disturbed in any way at all until I say
so.”</p>

<p>“But that <em>is</em> the law, Doctor. You are quite within
your rights to dictate concerning your patient.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to dictate. I’m just as willing as
anybody to have the criminal side of this mess cleared
up, if there is a criminal side.”</p>

<p>“Endicott would hardly have crawled into a
cupboard to have a stroke, would he, Doctor?”</p>

<p>“No.” Dr. Worth’s intelligent eyes stared
speculatively at Lieutenant Valcour for a minute. “Not
unless he’d hidden in there to overhear something,
and did overhear something that gave him a stroke,”
he said.</p>

<p>The cesspool, Lieutenant Valcour decided, was
beginning to show strange depths within its depth.
The medical examiner came over and joined them.
He complimented Dr. Worth briefly on the success
of his operation, assured Lieutenant Valcour that
the homicide chief would be given a full report of
Endicott’s recovery, and presumed that from now on
the case would be left in Lieutenant Valcour’s hands.
Lieutenant Valcour would deal with whatever
charges of robbery or assault might develop from it.
He said good-bye and left the room, with the fullest
intention of going right straight home to bed; and so
he promptly did, as soon as he had made the
promised report to Andrews.</p>

<p>Dr. Worth pointedly raised his eyebrows. “Then
there will be charges, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“That will depend largely upon Endicott, Doctor.
As he is now revived he will tell us himself who
attacked him, or the nature of the circumstance that
gave him the shock.”</p>

<p>“I trust so.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any doubt, is there?”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth grew expansive. “Certainly there is a
doubt,” he said. “While it is true that Endicott
has been revived, it is impossible to state definitely
that he will recover consciousness. And even granting
that he should recover consciousness, there is also a
chance that he might prefer not to make any statement
at all. What would you do then, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Fold my tents, Doctor, and fade away.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth looked down a long straight nose for a
minute at tips of low patent-leather shoes. “And if
Endicott does not recover consciousness,” he said
softly, “what will you do then?”</p>

<p>“You’ll be surprised at the number of things I
will do then.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth’s eyes, surfeited with patent leather,
snapped up sharply. “I must impress on you that
Mrs. Endicott is not to be disturbed,” he said.</p>

<p>“She won’t be, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Nurse Vickers, who helped me into her room
with her, is going to stay with Mrs. Endicott all night.
Two day nurses will come in the morning: one for her,
if necessary, and surely one for Endicott. I need
scarcely impress upon you the seriousness of <em>his</em>
condition.” Dr. Worth made a gesture of irritated
bewilderment. “I wish I knew him more
intimately—who his friends are, I mean.”</p>

<p>“He never talked with you about them?”</p>

<p>“Never. He seems an unusually reticent man, with
an almost abnormally developed feeling for privacy
concerning his intimate affairs.” Dr. Worth’s manner
grew definitely severe. Mentally, he wagged a finger
under Lieutenant Valcour’s nose. “He mustn’t have
any further shock. There must be nothing, absolutely
nothing that will shock him when, and if, he regains
consciousness.” He directed his attention momentarily
to the nurse. “Get those shades back on the lamps,
please, Miss Murrow, and turn out the ceiling lights.
And now, Lieutenant, to continue about Endicott.
As she is under the influence of the narcotic I gave
her, it is out of the question that his wife be here. I
wish she could be. I want the first person he sees to
be someone he knows—loves. His mind, you see, will
pick up functioning at the precise second where it left
off—at least, such is my conclusion.”</p>

<p>“And that was one of shock.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lieutenant, evidently one of shock or of
great fear. We cannot overestimate the importance of
getting him past it safely. Personally, I shall sleep
here in the house to-night, and Nurse Murrow will
call me if Endicott shows any signs of coming to.
That may not be before morning. I hope so, in a way,
as the effect of the narcotic will have worn off by then,
and Mrs. Endicott can be in here with him.”</p>

<p>“One of the servants might know of some friend,”
Lieutenant Valcour suggested. “I take it you would
like a friend to sit here with him during the night?”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth was emphatic. “It is almost a necessity
that there should be. The mental and nervous
viewpoints, you see, predominate in the case.”</p>

<p>“There is just one thing that I would like to
arrange, too, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I want to keep a couple of men posted all night
in the bathroom. They can sit on chairs just inside
the doorway there, where they can watch the bed,
but where Endicott can’t see them. He need never
know they are there.”</p>

<p>“What on earth would be the need for that?”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s quite simple, Doctor. When Endicott
comes to he will be in a position to tell us who gave
him the shock—a shock sufficient almost to kill
him—one which would have killed him if we hadn’t found
him to-night—and if,” he added thoughtfully, “Mrs.
Endicott hadn’t had her suspicions.”</p>

<p>“But why the men in the bathroom?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t want to take any chances of there
being a repetition before Endicott makes his
statement.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth pursed his lips and looked very wise
indeed. “I see,” he said. “I see. You are afraid that
the same person might get at him again and, well,
silence him before he could talk.”</p>

<p>“Something like that, Doctor.” Lieutenant Valcour
became courteously formal. “As the physician
in charge of this case, sir, have you any objection
to my stationing the two men in the bathroom?”</p>

<p>“Providing Endicott isn’t able to see them and
won’t be disturbed by them in any way at all.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s settled. You’ll have a nurse in here
all the time, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m going to ask her to keep this hall door
locked on the inside. She can open it if anyone
knocks, and my men will keep their eyes on whoever
comes in.”</p>

<p>“The precautions seem extraordinary, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“And so does the case. I’ll go downstairs now and
try to find out something from the servants about
his friends. I’ll tell them, if you like, about your
staying here, in case there is anything that has to be
got ready.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, Doctor.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour went outside. He found the
maid Jane in the hallway, seated on a chair near the
stairs, trembling. A tray with an empty glass was on
the floor beside her. She saw him, picked up the tray,
and stood up.</p>

<p>“I’m that upset, sir,” she said, “<em>that</em> upset.”</p>

<p>“Something has startled you?”</p>

<p>“Startled! Glory be, sir—what with this bringing
back of the dead and the missus gone into a comma—if
it wasn’t for them three cops at the downstairs
doors I’d be out of this house this minute, and so
would the rest of us, too.”</p>

<p>“How many of the ‘rest of you’ are there?”</p>

<p>“Sure and including the housekeeper there’s eight
of us, sir.”</p>

<p>The Endicotts, Lieutenant Valcour was now quite
certain, must be multimillionaires.</p>

<p>“All women?”</p>

<p>“Except for the houseman and chauffeur.”</p>

<p>“And do they sleep in the house?”</p>

<p>“The chauffeur does not, sir. He has an apartment
for himself and his wife and his three-year-old child,
named Katie, over the garage in East Sixty-sixth
Street, sir.”</p>

<p>“Have all of you been in service here a long time?”</p>

<p>“Indeed and we haven’t, sir—except for Roberts
and the housekeeper. I’ve been here a month myself,
and the rest of us not more than two or three.”</p>

<p>“And Roberts has been Mrs. Endicott’s maid for
the past several years, say?”</p>

<p>“And sure and ever since she landed here from
England, sir.”</p>

<p>“Roberts is an Englishwoman?”</p>

<p>“Hold your whisht, sir, and I’ll tell you that she’s
of the aristocracy, no less.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour considered this gravely. It was
not improbable. Many English families were utterly
wrecked financially by the war, and the children had
scattered whither they could, like sparrows, in search
of bread. “You’re sure of this?” he said.</p>

<p>“And indeed it is common knowledge, sir. The
housekeeper herself, it was, who told me.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour switched suddenly. “I wonder
whether you could tell me who Mr. Endicott’s
intimate friends were,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, there’s quite a few people have called
on the madam off and on, and a few on Mr. Endicott,
too. I couldn’t say, though, as to just how intimate.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t he ever discuss his friends?”</p>

<p>“Not before me, sir. I’m one of the downstairs
girls. Perhaps Roberts would know. She’s often in the
room with the madam and Mr. Endicott even when
the pair of them is quarrelling that hard
that—— Glory be to——”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut,” said Lieutenant Valcour gently.
“Married couples are always quarrelling together.
There’s nothing unusual in that.”</p>

<p>“Indeed and there ain’t.”</p>

<p>“I wonder whether you’d ask Roberts to come out
here and see me.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh—and will you also tell whoever has to know
about it that Dr. Worth plans to stay here all night?
And then let him know, please, where he is to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Jane went to the door of Mrs. Endicott’s room and
knocked. Nurse Vickers opened it and stepped halfway
out, blocking the entrance. Their voices were
too low for Lieutenant Valcour to hear, but he saw
the nurse retreat into the room, caught an affirmative
nod from Jane, and presently Roberts came out and
toward him.</p>

<p>“You wished to see me, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>There was still that curious shielding in her eyes—a
hinting at definite information kept closely guarded
behind twin gates.</p>

<p>“I want you to tell me,” he said quietly, “why
you compelled me a while ago in Mrs. Endicott’s
room to say ‘Later.’ ”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I quite understand.”</p>

<p>“And I believe that you do.”</p>

<p>Roberts became coolly detached. “One is justified
in having one’s beliefs.”</p>

<p>“Just why do you hate Mrs. Endicott so?”</p>

<p>She flinched as if he had struck her physically.</p>

<p>“Is that why you sent for me?” she said.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour himself indulged in a veiling of
eyes. “I wish,” he said, “that you would sit down.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch09">

<h2>Chapter IX. <br> 11:55 p. m.—Queer Deeps</h2>

<p>Roberts went indifferently to the chair that Jane
had been using and sat down. Lieutenant Valcour
drew another up beside her. He began with the usual
distant skirmishing before launching the main body
of his attack.</p>

<p>“I will explain why I wanted to see you,” he said.
“It’s concerning Mr. Endicott—concerning his
condition.” He noted the sudden reflex from tension
on the part of her hands as he summed up concisely
the statement made to him by Dr. Worth. “I understand,”
he concluded, “that Mrs. Endicott is under
the influence of a narcotic and will not be available
before to-morrow morning at the earliest. Dr. Worth
naturally wants to prevent all risk, and so we’ve
turned to you.”</p>

<p>He felt her staring through him, as if by some
fourth-dimensional process his being had been erased
from her vision.</p>

<p>“Mr. Endicott has very few friends,” she said.</p>

<p>“You are taking the word at its literal meaning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite. His acquaintances are numerous and
transient.” She focussed him into an entity again.
“They are mostly women. I don’t suppose one of
them would do?”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour smiled slightly. “Not if their
status is so uncertain—their emotional status, I
mean.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.” The masked effect of her attitude
remained unchanged as she asked with almost
perfunctory detachment, “Would a man do?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because there is one man of whom Mr. Endicott
speaks quite frequently as being his ‘best’ friend.”</p>

<p>“Here in town?”</p>

<p>“In a bachelor apartment on East Fifty-second
Street.”</p>

<p>“You have his exact address?”</p>

<p>“It is in the memorandum book beside the
telephone in Mrs. Endicott’s room.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour grew markedly casual. “A
mutual friend, then?”</p>

<p>“One couldn’t say.”</p>

<p>“He is your only suggestion?”</p>

<p>“He is the only man to whom I have heard Mr.
Endicott refer in terms of friendship and of intimacy.”</p>

<p>“Then there really isn’t any choice.”</p>

<p>Roberts’ smile signified nothing. “No choice.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen this man?”</p>

<p>“His name is Mr. Thomas Hollander. I have never
seen him.”</p>

<p>“Has anyone in the household ever seen him, to
your knowledge?”</p>

<p>“I dare say. I don’t know. One could inquire.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour recognized the rising inflection
at each period mark, a habit so much in vogue among
certain types of English people when they wish to be
mildly disagreeable. He felt a Gallic insistence to
retaliate even at the expense of chivalry. At the worst,
he thought, he would only be living up to the popular
conception of the men in his profession. And there
<em>was</em> some link of peculiar intimacy between this
woman and Endicott. . . .</p>

<p>“If we cannot get hold of Mr. Hollander,” he said,
“would you consider it advisable for the post to be
taken by yourself?”</p>

<p>He repented instantly at the sight of her deadly
whiteness. It seemed impossible that blood could
drain so swiftly from the skin. His own face blazed
like fire from the slap of her hand across his cheek.
He noticed, as he sat very still, the strange terror
that hid beneath her bitter, staring eyes: it wasn’t
any terror of the law, the cheek of which she had
symbolically in his person just so vigorously slapped;
it wasn’t any terror of what he or the machine he
represented could do to her—what anyone or anything
could do to her. . . . It was baffling; baffling as
the undiscoverable source of any intense emotional
reaction is baffling—something that drew its sustenance
from roots imbedded not in the immediate
present but in the past. . . .</p>

<p>“You will permit me to offer my apologies?” he said.</p>

<p>She returned vividly to the moment, and her colour
swept back in a succession of bright waves.</p>

<p>“I am not usually so unmannerly,” she said.</p>

<p>“Nor usually subjected to insult. The fault was
mine.”</p>

<p>Her laugh was quite harsh. “On the contrary,
Lieutenant, I am accustomed to insult.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you stay with Mrs. Endicott?”
he said softly.</p>

<p>“Because there are some people, Lieutenant, who
can only find their happiness in hell.”</p>

<p>“Martyrs.”</p>

<p>“Not martyrs, precisely.”</p>

<p>“Just what, then, precisely?”</p>

<p>“It’s a sharing, if you wish—sort of a sharing of
torture.”</p>

<p>Vague—vague. Lieutenant Valcour felt quite
convinced that he would shortly begin to gibber, if
the mysteries of hearts, of minds that he had dipped
into during the past few hours, did not soon coalesce
within the mould of reason. He began to envy his
sterner compatriots on the force who confined their
processes to the comfortable fields of hard, cold
facts—the “did you at five-forty-five this afternoon
place the silver teaspoon on the pantry shelf, or did
you not?” sort of facts. He conceded that their
wholesome, plein-air tactics were quite right, and that
his own, in spite of their usually successful results,
were hopelessly wrong. They at least were never called
liars, or slapped in the face, or found themselves
helplessly swirling in a sea of metaphysics with a splendid
chance of being thoroughly drowned. He forced himself
to concentrate. What was it that slash of pale
lips had been saying? A sharing of something . . . Of
course, of torture.</p>

<p>“You mean,” he said, “a sharing that is now going
on?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps—but especially in the past. Do you
believe, Lieutenant, that the dead remain in
emotional touch with the living?”</p>

<p>“And that, my poor fish,” he told himself severely,
“is what your interminable probing into people’s
souls has got you into.”</p>

<p>“I have never thought about it. But I should like
to believe that it is true. I should like to believe in
anything that offers corroborative proof of
immortality.”</p>

<p>“You are convinced of the finality of death?”</p>

<p>“It is a dread, not a conviction.”</p>

<p>Roberts nodded her head swiftly. “And with
me—with me—if I could only <em>know</em>.”</p>

<p>“So that you would be quite certain that your
sacrifice is not being made in vain.” Lieutenant
Valcour spoke very softly. He was approaching, he
felt, no matter how grandiloquently, that goal
toward which he had been aiming: the answer to the
amazing look she had given him in Mrs. Endicott’s
room.</p>

<p>The mood broke. She stood up abruptly.</p>

<p>“You wished that address book?” she said.</p>

<p>It was of no great matter. Moods, at least, did not
die. They were always there—somewhere—waiting
to be recaptured.</p>

<p>“If you will be so kind,” he said.</p>

<p>She went to the door of Mrs. Endicott’s room,
opened it, was swallowed up. Lieutenant Valcour
waited outside. The case was becoming mired in
evasions. That was the trouble with cases whose milieu
rose beyond a certain social and mental level. They
invariably grew kaleidoscopic with overtones. Crime
in the lower strata was noteworthy for its crudenesses
rather than its subtleties: an intrigue among animals,
with the general patentness of some jackal filching its
prey. But breeding and intellect generally presupposed
masks: the inbred defensiveness of manner and
social combativeness with the world which offered
barriers most difficult to pierce. Roberts opened the
door and handed him the small leather reference book
Mrs. Endicott had used when verifying the telephone
number of Dr. Worth.</p>

<p>“Thomas Hollander,” she said. “The names are
listed alphabetically.”</p>

<p>The door closed even in that short second which
preceded his thanks. It was a gesture of retreat from
hinted intimacies. It wasn’t so much the door of the
room she had closed as it was the door guarding her
secrets. He felt that she wanted to show him she had
already repented of having gone so far—not that she
<em>had</em> gone any distance, really, but there were beacons,
faint pin points of light toward which he would chart
a course over the surface of her troubled seas.</p>

<p>He took the reference book and sat down. He began
with A and started to go systematically through
it. At H he fixed in his memory the street and
telephone number of Hollander’s house. He continued
without interest to turn the pages.</p>

<p>At the end of the M’s he came, to his marked
bewilderment, upon the address and telephone
number of Marge Myles.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch10">

<h2>Chapter X. <br> 12:06 a. m.—The Stillness of a Grave</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour went to the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>“O’Brian!” he called down.</p>

<p>O’Brian looked up at him from below.</p>

<p>“Yes, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Send Hansen up here, please.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>A painting on the wall held Lieutenant Valcour’s
attention while he waited. A Gauguin, he thought,
and, going closer, confirmed it. His eye drifted over
the entire corridor. Everywhere were the details of
great wealth, and the young owner of it all not a
happy child of kind fortune, but a detested, a
passionately hated, and a passionately loved man. There
flashed again before him in brief review Mrs.
Endicott, a storehouse of mountain storms in summer;
Mrs. Siddons, spiritual ash; Roberts, the shortest
step this side of some fervour bred in the swamps of
lunacy; Hollander—Marge Myles—who knew? And
would one ever know? Suppose, as Dr. Worth had
more than hinted, Endicott should refuse to speak—if
that strange reticence harped upon so insistently
both by his wife and his physician should resist . . .</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, sir, Officer Hansen reporting.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour dragged his eyes from the
Gauguin unwillingly.</p>

<p>“All right, Hansen,” he said. “Come with me.”</p>

<p>They went down the corridor and stopped before
the door to Endicott’s room.</p>

<p>“Do you know what’s gone on here to-night,
Hansen?”</p>

<p>“From what I’ve heard, sir, the man who was
thought dead is now alive.”</p>

<p>“That is correct.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour opened the door and beckoned
to Cassidy. Cassidy came out and joined them.</p>

<p>“When you two men go back into that room,”
Lieutenant Valcour said, “I want you to get a couple
of chairs and sit down just inside the bathroom
doorway. Put the chairs where you can watch the
bed and this hall door. If you talk, use a low voice
that won’t disturb either the patient or the nurse,
and from the moment when she indicates that he’s
returning to consciousness, say nothing at all and sit
still. The shock of knowing that you were there might
disturb his heart again. Is that clear?”</p>

<p>They assured him, in unison, that it was.</p>

<p>“This hall door,” Lieutenant Valcour went on,
“is going to be kept locked on the inside by the nurse.
Every time she opens it, watch carefully. Keep your
eye on anyone who comes into the room, especially
if they offer some excuse for wanting to be
there—and when I say ‘anyone,’ I mean just that. For
instance: the nurse might want some coffee and ring
for a servant. Watch that servant every second, until
she goes and the door is locked again. While on the
subject of coffee, you will drink none that may be
offered you while you’re on watch.”</p>

<p>“I never drink coffee, Lieutenant,” said Cassidy.
“Now if it was a cup of tea——”</p>

<p>“If you get thirsty,” said Lieutenant Valcour
severely, “take some water from the tap. And eat
nothing at all. I don’t want to have to come back
here and find you both groggy with knock-out drops
and with heaven-knows-what happened to Endicott.
Mind you, I’m not suggesting that anything like
this will happen—but it might. Clear?”</p>

<p>Again, in unison, they assured him it was all most
clear.</p>

<p>“Keep in mind,” Lieutenant Valcour went on,
“that primarily you are in a sick-room over which
Dr. Worth has absolute charge. You are not to
interfere with anything he may do, or with any
arrangements he may make during the night. You
are only to step in if you see that Endicott’s life is
threatened through the action of some person who
may approach him. Try to prevent this by physically
overpowering the attacker if you can, but if there is
no time for that do not hesitate to shoot.”</p>

<p>“Even if it’s a woman, Lieutenant?” said Hansen
quietly.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour shrugged. “There are no such
things,” he said evenly, “as sex or chivalry in
murder.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I am painting, incidentally, the darkest prospect
of the picture. In all probability nothing will happen
at all. You’ll spend a sleepless and tiresome night,
get cricks in your necks, and damn the day you ever
joined the force. Now, then, there is one thing more,
and that concerns a man by the name of Thomas
Hollander. Dr. Worth believes it advisable that an
intimate friend of Endicott be near him and be the
first person whom Endicott sees when he recovers
consciousness. Mr. Hollander is that friend. I am
going to try to get in touch with him shortly, explain
matters to him, and get him to come up here. Mr.
Hollander is naturally the exception to my previous
instructions. Let him alone. Don’t interfere with
him, but—” Lieutenant Valcour’s pause was
significantly impressive “—watch him. Watch him, my
good young men, as two harmonious cats might watch
a promenading and near-sighted mouse. Shall I
repeat?”</p>

<p>“I get you, Lieutenant,” said Cassidy. And
Hansen, he was assured, had “got” him, too.</p>

<p>“Then we will go in, and you will establish
yourselves for the night at once.”</p>

<p>He opened the door, and they went inside. Dr.
Worth’s arrangements were complete, and he was
ready to turn in. Nurse Murrow had received her
instructions and was to call Dr. Worth should
Endicott show any symptoms of returning consciousness.</p>

<p>Dr. Worth joined Lieutenant Valcour at the door.</p>

<p>“There is nothing further we can do for the
present, Lieutenant, except wait,” he said.</p>

<p>“All right, Doctor. I’ve told my men how things
stand.” He nodded toward Cassidy and Hansen,
who, on tiptoe, were vanishing into the bathroom
with two chairs. “I’ve told them you’re in charge
here, and that there’s not to be an unnecessary sound
or move out of them.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth continued to remain politely incredulous.
“Well, I dare say you know what you are doing,
but it still seems an extraordinary precaution to me.”</p>

<p>“And it probably is. I spoke to one of the maids
about your staying here, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Yes—thank you. They’ve told me where my room
is. It’s the one directly above this one.”</p>

<p>“I’ve also lined up one of Endicott’s friends. I’m
getting in touch with him directly, and when he
comes I’ll have him sent up to you. You can tell him
just what you want him to do, and then see that he
gets in here all right, if you will, please.”</p>

<p>“By all means. Who is he, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“A Mr. Thomas Hollander—lives on East
Fifty-second Street.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of him; but there’s no reason why I
should have.” He sped a parting look toward Endicott,
faintly breathing on the bed. “The most
reticent man, Lieutenant, whom I have ever met.”</p>

<p>They went outside and closed the door.</p>

<p>Nurse Murrow went over and locked it. She felt,
to put it mildly, not a little atwitter. Her life had
not conformed to the popular version of a trained
nurse’s. There had been no romantic patients in it
whose pallid, interesting brows she had smoothly
divorced from fever by a gentle pass or two with
magnetic fingers. No grateful millionaire had offered
her his heart and name; nor had any motherly eyed
old dowager died and willed her a fortune. No. There
had been, on the other hand, a good many years of
sloppy, disillusioning, grilling work, long hours spent
in pampering peevish patients, patients who were
ugly with that special ugliness which is inherent in
the sick, snappish doctors, and a perfect desert of
romance.</p>

<p>The present case loomed as a heaven-sent oasis.
Who knew what might not develop out of it? It
awakened all the atrophied hunger of her starved
sentimentalism. And even if nothing <em>did</em> result from
it—nothing practical, like marriage, or a good
bonus—it would at least leave her something to think
about during those endless, tiresome, tiring hours of
the future. . . .</p>

<p>She crossed to the bed and looked down at Endicott.
She felt his pulse and made a notation on her
night chart. She lingered near the bathroom
doorway.</p>

<p>“The strangest case,” she whispered, “that I’ve
ever been on.”</p>

<p>Cassidy looked up at her bleakly.</p>

<p>Hansen said, “Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” she whispered on, “that it’s quite
in the ordinary run of things for you gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“There’s an atmosphere—a something sinister——”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Nurse Murrow’s broad shoulders jerked impatiently.
There was a talk-chilling quality in being
so determinedly ma’am’d. She gave it up, and settled
herself starchily in an armchair. She adjusted a lamp
so that it shaded more efficiently her eyes.</p>

<p>A floor board creaked upstairs—once.</p>

<p>That would be Dr. Worth, she decided, going to
bed. What a man! What a shining light in his profession!
A little bigoted, perhaps, in some things, but
so distinguished—admirable—a bachelor,
too—— But what nonsense!</p>

<p>A complete stillness settled gently on the house.
The stillness of a grave.</p>

<p>Yes, she thought, just exactly that—the stillness
of a grave. . . .</p>

<h2>Chapter XI. <br> 12:15 a. m.—To Watch by Night</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour refreshed his memory from
the leather reference book and then dialled the
number.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thomas Hollander?” he said, when a man’s
voice answered him. It was a smooth, soft voice, and
he suspected that further words beyond the initial
“hello” would reveal a Southern accent.</p>

<p>“Who is calling, please?” went on the voice,
making the expected latitudinal revelation.</p>

<p>“I have a message from the home of Mr. Herbert
Endicott for Mr. Thomas Hollander. Will you ask
him to come to the ’phone, please?”</p>

<p>“One moment.”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour drew stars on a scratch pad
while he waited. He wondered idly what secret powers
or hidden vices they would disclose if examined by a
trained graphologist. He made quite a good star and
drew exciting rays out from its points. That would
undoubtedly show, he told himself, that he was a
nosey, mean-spirited, and cold-hearted sleuth hound.
What an infernal time it took to get Hollander to the
telephone! Had the line gone dead? Ah . . .</p>

<p>“Yes?” It was a deeper voice, this time, and held
no promise, or threat, of Southern softnesses.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thomas Hollander?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“This is the home of Mr. Herbert Endicott, Mr.
Hollander.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“And I am Lieutenant Valcour talking—of the
police.”</p>

<p>The deadness of the wire became a pause of the
first magnitude. Then:</p>

<p>“Well, Lieutenant, what’s it all about?”</p>

<p>“It is about Mr. Endicott, Mr. Hollander.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Another pause.</p>

<p>“He’s dead?”</p>

<p>“Dead? Why no, Hollander. Were you expecting
him to be?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘expecting him to be’?
Certainly I wasn’t. Please come down to facts,
Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“I was about to. Mr. Endicott has suffered a heart
attack brought on by some sudden shock. His
condition is serious, and Dr. Worth, who is attending
him, insists that some friend be at hand when Mr.
Endicott recovers consciousness.”</p>

<p>“You mean”—the voice was speaking very
carefully now—“in addition to Mrs. Endicott?”</p>

<p>“No, unfortunately Mrs. Endicott cannot be
present.”</p>

<p>Again a pause, and then:</p>

<p>“Why not, Lieutenant? She isn’t—that is——”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Hollander?”</p>

<p>“Damn it, is she arrested?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. What for?”</p>

<p>“Well, what in hell are you cops in the house for
if”—the voice ended less belligerently—“there
hasn’t been some crime?”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour remained splendidly detached.</p>

<p>“We shan’t be certain that there either has or
hasn’t been a crime, as you infer, until Mr. Endicott
recovers consciousness and lets us know.”</p>

<p>“He’s unconscious?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is his condition serious, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Most serious, Mr. Hollander.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Endicott—why is it she can’t be with
Herb?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Worth has given her a narcotic. She’s
sleeping. Her nerves are unstrung.”</p>

<p>This evidently took a minute to digest.</p>

<p>“From what, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“From her husband’s condition.”</p>

<p>“Did Mrs. Endicott suggest that you call me up,
Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“No. Roberts, her maid, said you were a friend—a
mutual friend. Roberts tells me that your name is the
only one she has ever heard spoken by Mr. Endicott
in terms that would imply intimacy.”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“You and Mr. Endicott are intimate friends, are
you not?”</p>

<p>“Pretty thick, Lieutenant. What is it you want me
to do?”</p>

<p>“To sit with Mr. Endicott until he recovers
consciousness. Dr. Worth is afraid that his heart will go
back on him again if there isn’t someone he knows
with him when he comes to. If you’ll be kind enough
to come up, Dr. Worth will explain the whole peculiar
affair to you much better than I can.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course. Yes. When?”</p>

<p>“As soon as convenient.”</p>

<p>“In about an hour? There are some things——”</p>

<p>“That will do perfectly. Thank you very much,
Mr. Hollander. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour hung up the receiver of the
hall telephone he was using and walked to where he
had left his coat and hat. He put them on and
buttonholed O’Brian by the front door.</p>

<p>“O’Brian,” he said, “there’s a man coming here
shortly by the name of Thomas Hollander. Have him
identify himself by a visiting card, or a letter, or his
driver’s licence, or initials on something or other.
Give him a pat, too, in passing to make certain that
he hasn’t got a gun. If it offends him, say that it is
just a matter of routine. As a matter of fact, in his
case, it probably is. Then show him up to the room
that Dr. Worth is occupying for the night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“From Dr. Worth’s room he will be taken down
to Mr. Endicott’s room and will stay there until
morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I want you to tip the men off on guard down here
that I want it known I am going home until to-morrow.
Tell Mr. Hollander that if he asks to see me.
I am leaving the house now and may be gone for a
couple of hours, more or less. Then I’m coming back.
I’ll rap on this door here, and you let me in.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“There’s probably a lounge or something in that
room there just off this hall. I’ll spend the night on
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“What is the name of the gentleman who is
coming?”</p>

<p>“Thomas Hollander, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Good.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour went outside. The normal orderliness
of life returned comfortingly with the first
deep breaths of cold night air. He walked the short
half block to Fifth Avenue and hailed a taxi. He got
in. He gave the driver, through the half-opened
window in front, the Riverside Drive address of Marge
Myles.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch12">

<h2>Chapter XII. <br> 12:30 a. m.—Madame Velasquez Stirs up Muck</h2>

<p>The taxi ran north along Fifth Avenue for a few
blocks and then bore left into the leafless, frosty
stretches of Central Park. It was deserted of
pedestrians. Occasional yellow lights showed the vacant
surface of benches and empty walks.</p>

<p>The average worthlessness of any person’s reactions
when suddenly confronted by the police, Lieutenant
Valcour reflected, was a curious phenomenon.
It was his belief that only rarely were such reactions
the result of the moment at hand. They were instead
a subconscious scurrying backward to some earlier
time when something had been done by that person,
or known by that person, which might then have
brought him into the grip of the law. No one—he
included himself in the arraignment—led a blameless
life. No, not even the saints, for they had their
periods of expiation, which in themselves presupposed
blemishes that required the act of expiation for their
erasure. And so it was with people when, even in the
rôle of the most innocent of bystanders, they were
confronted by the police. Inevitably there lurked a
certain fear, an instinctive thrusting out of defenses
as a guard against the chance discovery of that early
blemish. . . .</p>

<p>Take Hollander, for instance. Every word of his
telephone conversation had been a negative defense,
and yet one could not link it necessarily with the
attack on Endicott. No, not necessarily. It was
perfectly obvious that Hollander had <em>expected</em> something
to happen to Endicott, and equally obvious that he
was worried about the fact that Mrs. Endicott might
be involved in it, but one couldn’t say that he had
been involved in it himself. . . .</p>

<p>The taxi stopped. Lieutenant Valcour got out, paid
the driver, and dismissed him.</p>

<p>Riverside Drive seemed about ten degrees colder
than the midtown section of the city had been. Or was
it fifteen or twenty degrees? A northerly wind blew
iced blasts from the Hudson River and at him across
the treetops of the terraced park. Marge Myles,
Lieutenant Valcour decided as he took in the façade
of the building that housed her apartment, did
herself rather well.</p>

<p>A sleepy and irritable Negro casually asked him
“Wha’ floor—’n’ who, suh?” as he entered the
overheated lobby. The boy was smartly snapped into full
consciousness by the view offered him of Lieutenant
Valcour’s gold badge.</p>

<p>The proper floor proved to be the fourteenth.</p>

<p>As the hour was hovering about one in the morning,
Lieutenant Valcour was considerably surprised at the
promptness with which the door swung open in
response to his ring, and considerably more surprised
by the querulous voice that emerged from beneath a
wig, dimly seen in the poor light of a foyer, and said,
“Well, I must say you took your own time in coming.
Put your coat and hat on that table there, and then
come into the parlour.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour complied. He followed a dimmish
mass of jet bugles into the more accurate light
of a room heavily cluttered with gold-leafed furniture
and brocades.</p>

<p>“I’m Madame Velasquez—Marge’s ma. I ain’t
Spanish myself, but if there ever was a Spaniard, my
late husband Alvarez was.”</p>

<p>The wig on Madame Velasquez’s head offered no
anachronism to the bugles of her low-cut dress. Its
reddish russet strands were pompadoured and puffed
and showed at unexpected places little sprays of
determined curls. The face beneath it bore an odd
resemblance to an enamelled nut to which nature,
in a moment of freakish humour, had added features.</p>

<p>“Now I want you to tell me at once, Mr. Endicott,
what you have done with my little Marge.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour with curious eyes tried to
probe a closed door at the other end of the room.</p>

<p>“I expected to find her here, Madame Velasquez,”
he said quietly. “Isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“She ain’t. And what is furthermore, Mr. Herbert
Endicott, you know she ain’t.” Her voice had grown
shrill, but without much volume. It was rather the
ineffective piping of some winded bird.</p>

<p>“What makes you say that, Madame Velasquez?”</p>

<p>The bunched strands of artificial jewellery that
were recklessly clasped about Madame Velasquez’s
thin neck quivered defiantly.</p>

<p>“And you never met her here at seven,” she said.
“I suppose you’ll say you <em>wasn’t</em> to meet her here at
seven. Well, I got this note to prove it. There, now.”</p>

<p>She handed Lieutenant Valcour a sheet of
notepaper that reeked of some high-powered scent.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Make yourself at home, Ma [read the note]. Herb Endicott was
  to meet me here at seven. He didn’t come although he was to take
  me to the Colonial for dinner. I am going to the Colonial now and
  see if he is there. Maybe I did not understand him right, Ma.
  I will be home soon anyways.</p>

  <p class="signature">Marge.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“And it is now,” said Madame Velasquez, “after
1 <span class="sc">a. m.</span>”</p>

<p>“She knew you were going to pay her this visit,
Madame Velasquez?”</p>

<p>“I telegraphed her this afternoon. I’m here for a
week. Where is she?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where she is, Madame Velasquez.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Endicott, one more lie like that and I’ll call
the police.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Madame Velasquez. You see, I
am the police.”</p>

<p>The bugles, the jewels, the curls became still with
shocking abruptness, as a brake that without warning
binds tightly.</p>

<p>“You belong to the police?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Madame Velasquez—Lieutenant Valcour.”</p>

<p>He showed his badge.</p>

<p>“Then you ain’t Mr. Endicott?”</p>

<p>“No, Madame Velasquez.”</p>

<p>“Then he—she—they’ve gone and done it,
Lieutenant—they have run away.” Madame Velasquez
began to simper.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Madame Velasquez, but they haven’t
run away. Mr. Endicott, you see, was attacked this
evening. If he doesn’t live, whoever did it will be
charged with murder.”</p>

<p>There was a complete absence of expression in
Madame Velasquez’s tone. “And you think Marge
done it,” she said.</p>

<p>“Not necessarily so at all. Your daughter may very
well have met somebody else at the Colonial—some
other party of friends—and have joined it when Mr.
Endicott failed to show up. The Colonial is closed by
now, but perhaps she went on to some night club.
I shouldn’t worry.”</p>

<p>“Why should she go on to some night club when
she knew her ma was waiting for her here?”</p>

<p>Madame Velasquez’s thin hands, the fingers of
which were loaded with cheap rings, played nervously
with any substance they chanced to touch.</p>

<p>“Something’s happened to her, Lieutenant,” she
went on. “I always told her as how it would. Marge—I
told her a hundred times if I ever told her once—there’s
a limit to the number of suckers you can play
at one and the same time.”</p>

<p>“You think that some man who was jealous perhaps
attacked Endicott first and then got after her?”</p>

<p>“Man? Men, Lieutenant, men. That brat kept the
opposite of a harem, if you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“She isn’t your daughter, really, is she, Madame
Velasquez?”</p>

<p>“She was Alvarez’s only child by his first wife—some
Spanish female hussy from Seville. What made
you guess?”</p>

<p>“The way you talked about her. But do keep right
on, Madame Velasquez. What a remarkable pendant—it’s
a rarity to see so perfect a ruby—may I?”</p>

<p>Madame Velasquez simpered audibly while Lieutenant
Valcour leaned forward and stared earnestly
at the bit of paste.</p>

<p>“My late husband, Lieutenant, used to say that
nothing was too good for pretty Miramar. That’s my
name, Lieutenant—Miramar.”</p>

<p>“Few people are so happily named, Madame
Velasquez. Tell me—let me rely upon your woman’s
intuition—just what did Marge expect from
Endicott?”</p>

<p>Madame Velasquez leaned forward confidentially.
An atmosphere as of frenzied heliotropes clung
thickly about her.</p>

<p>“Every last damn nickel she could get,” she said.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour assumed his most winning
smile. “Scarcely an <i>affaire du cœur</i>, Madame
Velasquez.” If he had had a moustache, he would have
twirled it. “I suppose her early marriage embittered
her, rather hardened her against men?”</p>

<p>“Well, if it did I ain’t noticed it none.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Endicott came under the heading of
business rather than pleasure?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, and then no.”</p>

<p>“A happy combination?”</p>

<p>“Just a combination. Not so damn happy.”</p>

<p>“A little bickering now and then?”</p>

<p>“A lot.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? Marge was on the stage, wasn’t she?”</p>

<p>“If you can call it the stage nowadays,
Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“In the chorus, wasn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And Harry Myles saw her and carried her off.”</p>

<p>Madame Velasquez’s laugh was an art; unfortunately
not a lost one. “The millionaire marriage,”
she gasped. “My dear”—her hand found a resting
place on one of Lieutenant Valcour’s knees—“he
didn’t have a cent.”</p>

<p>“She felt disappointed, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Disappointed!” Madame Velasquez fairly
screamed the word at him, like an angry parrot. Her
manner changed and became darkly mysterious. “I
know my little know,” she said. “You can believe
me, Lieutenant, little Miramar’s not the boob some
parties I could mention, but won’t, think she is.”
Her voice grew harsh with the gritty quality of a file.
“I’ll learn her to leave me in the ditch like this.”</p>

<p>“Then you think Marge purposely isn’t here to
greet you?”</p>

<p>It was a sweet little bunch of filth, taken all in all,
thought Lieutenant Valcour. It was perfectly plain:
Madame Velasquez either held definite knowledge
that Marge had killed Harry Myles, or else had
convinced Marge that she knew. And then Madame
Velasquez had simply bled Marge of all the money
she could get.</p>

<p>“Is Marge frightened easily, Madame Velasquez?”</p>

<p>“About some things.”</p>

<p>The reddish, dusty-looking curls nodded vigorously.
Lieutenant Valcour looked at his watch. It was
one-thirty. He stood up.</p>

<p>“Thank you for receiving me, Madame Velasquez.
If I leave you a telephone number would you care to
call me up when Marge comes in? Or will you be in
bed?”</p>

<p>“Leave your number, Lieutenant.” The seamy
enamelled face became more nutlike than ever. “I
got a thing or two to talk over with that female
Brigham Young.” She raised a be-ringed hand and
held it unescapably close to Lieutenant Valcour’s
lips.</p>

<p>He brushed them gently against a hardened coat
of whiting, smiled his pleasantest, and left, assisted
doorward by what might at one time have been
called a sigh.</p>

<p>He paused for a moment in the small foyer, after
putting on his hat and coat, and pencilled the
Endicotts’ telephone number on one of his cards. He
started back to give it to Madame Velasquez.</p>

<p>She wasn’t in the room where he had left her, and
the room’s other door stood ajar. He crossed to it
softly and looked in. Madame Velasquez—yes,
he convinced himself, it <em>was</em> Madame Velasquez—was
sitting before a dresser. Her wig was off, and her
heavily enamelled face peered into a mirror beneath
thin knots of corn-gray hair. As the lonely, weak old
voice rose and fell, Lieutenant Valcour caught a
word or two of what Madame Velasquez was saying:</p>

<p>“He didn’t know—if I went and told her once, I
told her a thousand times—he didn’t <em>know</em>.” There
followed a short, dreadful noise that passed as
laughter. “But <em>I</em> know—Miramar knows,
darling—you little lousy . . .”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour retreated softly. He left the
card lying on a table. He went outside and closed the
door. He rang for the elevator and shut his eyes while
waiting for it to come up. There were times when
they grew a little weary from looking too intimately
upon life.</p>

<p>Down in the lobby he used the house telephone
and called up the Endicotts’.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Valcour talking,” he said.</p>

<p>“O’Brian, sir.”</p>

<p>“Everything quiet?”</p>

<p>“Indeed and it is, sir.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hollander get there yet?”</p>

<p>“He’s just this minute after arriving, sir. He’s
upstairs with Dr. Worth now.”</p>

<p>“Did he identify himself all right?”</p>

<p>“He did that, Lieutenant, with cards and a driver’s
licence.”</p>

<p>“Good. I’ll be along in about an hour now.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>He was helped by the bitter wind as he walked east
to Broadway. He found a taxi and gave the driver
Hollander’s address on East Fifty-second Street. He
settled back and closed his eyes. He went to sleep.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch13">

<h2>Chapter XIII. <br> 2:01 a. m.—Glittering Eyes</h2>

<p>Nurse Murrow didn’t slumber, exactly; it was much
too slender a lapse from consciousness for that. But
it was not until the second gentle rapping that she
stood up.</p>

<p>Someone was rapping on the hall door.</p>

<p>She glanced at her wrist watch as she crossed the
room, and was glad to note that it was just after two
o’clock. Three or four hours, now, and it would be
dawn. She’d get some coffee, then, and her work for
the night would be almost over.</p>

<p>As she turned the key in the lock she noticed with
a sharp thrill of interest that the two policemen, very
quiet, very alert, but still sitting on their chairs in
the bathroom doorway, had each drawn a gun from
its holster and was holding it by his side. She opened
the door.</p>

<p>Dr. Worth, his dignity considerably muffled in
camel’s hair, stood in the corridor with a stranger.</p>

<p>“Miss Murrow,” he said, “this is Mr. Thomas
Hollander, the friend who is going to sit up with
Mr. Endicott. He understands everything about the
situation, and I have advised him just what to do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Doctor.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth failed futilely in suppressing a yawn.
“Are there any reports?”</p>

<p>“No, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll return to my room. Call me at the
slightest indication.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Doctor.”</p>

<p>Hollander came inside. Miss Murrow closed the
door and locked it again. She stood watching Hollander
as he went an uncertain step or two toward the
bed, with that natural hesitation with which one
approaches the very ill. He was a personable young
man in his thirties. He was more than personable,
she decided. Not handsome, exactly—heavens, no—she
corrected herself rapidly. The features weren’t
moulded in the tiresome regularity of handsomeness.
Engaging? Perhaps. A body perfectly proportioned,
with the broad shoulders and slim hips of a
fighter—of, yes, a prize fighter—an amateur sportsman.</p>

<p>Hollander had finished with staring down at
Endicott. His walk, as he came over to where she was
standing, caused Miss Murrow to change her opinion
as to his vocation. She put him down as a sailor, a
yachtsman. There was a buoyancy, a certain fluidity,
in his movements, as if his feet were accustomed to
maintaining him with poise across the surfaces of
moving things. His eyes, except for one flashing
glance, did not meet her own directly.</p>

<p>“Is it all right to smoke?” he said.</p>

<p>Miss Murrow smiled apologetically. “I’m afraid
not, Mr. Hollander. Mr. Endicott’s lungs require as
clear air as possible. I’ve even opened that window a
little to keep the atmosphere in the room quite
fresh.” She nodded toward the window above the
large mahogany chest. The sash was up about six or
seven inches from the bottom.</p>

<p>“Oh.” Hollander continued to stand before her,
giving her still that peculiar effect of movement.
There was nothing perceptible about it. His body was
like a stolid field, motionless, beneath drifting
shadows of the clouds. “Will Dr. Worth be here when
Herb comes to?”</p>

<p>Nurse Murrow felt a professional stiffening. “I
will inform Dr. Worth at the first sign of returning
consciousness.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>

<p>“How’ll you inform him?”</p>

<p>“By going up to his room, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” Hollander’s gaze wavered about at the line
of her chin. “Then I’ll just baby Herb along until
you get back down here with the doctor.”</p>

<p>“The doctor and I will undoubtedly be back before
Mr. Endicott actually does come to.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Good kid, Herb.”</p>

<p>She threw out a tentative feeler.</p>

<p>“You and he are great friends, Mr. Hollander?”</p>

<p>“Buddies. War buddies.”</p>

<p>Miss Murrow’s thoughts fled back along old trails.
“How splendid! So few war friendships have really
lasted, Mr. Hollander. I know it’s been so in my
case, and with so many, many others.” A faint flush
crept over her palish cheeks and made her look
rather young again. “There was a girl with me in
hospital at Chaumont, and we just knew we were
going to be friends for life, but she lives out in Akron,
Ohio.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“We wrote quite regularly for a while after we got
back from France—we both sailed from Brest on the
<i>Amerika</i>—but then it sort of dwindled. Postal
cards—picture postal cards at Christmas. Last year we
didn’t even send any. I wonder what she’d be like
if I saw her again. Have you ever wondered about
people whom you’ve once been very fond of, that
way—about whether they change in time, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Everything changes.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it, though? Just like the seasons. Oh, I
do think you can draw so many happy comparisons
between life and nature. They’re interlinked, if you
get what I mean. That’s why the weather is so affecting.
I just can’t <em>help</em> feeling gloomy on a gloomy day,
and when it’s bright and cheerful and all sunshiny
outside, why then I’m that way, too.”</p>

<p>“Cripes!” muttered Hollander softly.</p>

<p>“What did you say, Mr. Hollander?”</p>

<p>“I said that was nice.”</p>

<p>“Now I suppose with you and Mr. Endicott you
see each other quite regularly.”</p>

<p>“Now and then.”</p>

<p>“I suppose whenever your business permits?”</p>

<p>His look flicked her like a whip.</p>

<p>“Where’ll I sit?” he said.</p>

<p>Nurse Murrow vanished within her professional
sphere.</p>

<p>“Near the patient, please.”</p>

<p>She wondered whether he had meant to snub her.
It wasn’t a snub exactly. Yes, it was, too. Well, what
of it? He was attractive enough to get away with it,
and it probably was nothing but brusqueness, after
all. Many strong men were brusque—purposely so
to hide a tender interior. There was a man, and a
millionaire at that . . . Hollander was back again
beside her. She wondered whether it was so—whether
people who didn’t look into your eyes were people
whom it was unsafe to trust.</p>

<p>“Just what do you know about all this?” he said
softly.</p>

<p>“About all what, Mr. Hollander?”</p>

<p>“About the police being in the house.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it just too thrilling?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Whom do they suspect?”</p>

<p>Miss Murrow began to feel friendly again. He <em>was</em>
so good-looking. She wished she had a whole lot of
exciting and important information to give him that
would keep him standing there listening, so that she
could just stare at him and try to put her finger on
the source of that amazing effect of fluidity.</p>

<p>“They haven’t said whom they suspect, really.”
She lowered her voice to an appropriate pitch. “But
I know they think it’s somebody who is in the house.”</p>

<p>Hollander’s voice was a whisper. “You wouldn’t
say it was Mrs. Endicott whom they suspect, would
you?”</p>

<p>Miss Murrow appeared a trifle shocked. “Oh, it
would be too dreadful to think a wife would harm a
husband. But it does happen.” Her mind tabulated
the news offered daily by the papers. “Why, it
happens almost every day. Oh, you don’t <em>think</em>——”</p>

<p>“Certainly I don’t think she did it,” Hollander
said fiercely. “It’s what the police think that I’m
trying to get at. What makes you so sure they’re
going to hang it onto somebody who’s in the house?”</p>

<p>Miss Murrow nodded toward the bathroom door.
“From the way they’re guarding Mr. Endicott from
being attacked again. From being attacked,” she
added, “before he can make a statement.”</p>

<p>“Then they’re still just guessing?”</p>

<p>“Just guessing.”</p>

<p>It seemed to satisfy Hollander, and he managed
to convey the impression that the conversation, so
far as he was concerned, had come to an end. Miss
Murrow went over to her chair in a corner of the
room and sat down. He was deep, she decided. Yes, a
deep creature, with deep impulses. . . .</p>

<p>Cassidy and Hansen tilted back their chairs a bit
and, with loosened collars, settled for the last tiring
watches of the night. They had nodded briefly to
Hollander, and he had nodded just as briefly in return.
He looked to them like a good scout. Like one of
the boys. Regular. Cassidy tried to remember what
that last line of hooey was that the lieutenant had
shot at them about Hollander. Something about cats.
About two cats, that was it, watching a
promenading and near-sighted mouse. Nuts.</p>

<p>Hollander took an armchair and pushed it close
to the head of the bed. It was an upholstered armchair,
heavy, and with a tall solid back. He placed it
so that its back was to the bathroom door. The back
also obliquely obscured him from a full view on the
part of Nurse Murrow. He vanished into its overstuffed
depths and settled down. His eyes travelled
slowly along the spread until they came to rest with
a curious fixity on the smooth, masklike face of his
friend Endicott.</p>

<p>Then the pupils of Hollander’s eyes contracted
until they glittered like the heads of two bright pins.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV. <br> 2:01 a. m.—An Empty Sheath</h2>

<p>It was just after two o’clock when Lieutenant
Valcour stepped to the pavement and paid his fare to
the driver. The cab snorted away and left silence
hanging heavy on the street. The bachelor apartment
house where Hollander lived had an English basement
entrance. He found Hollander’s name among a
row of five others and pressed the proper button.
After he had pressed it four times, a voice answered
him through the earpiece of the announcer.</p>

<p>“Who and what is it?” said the voice.</p>

<p>It was the Southern voice.</p>

<p>“This is Lieutenant Valcour of the police
department talking.”</p>

<p>“Oh. Mr. Hollander has already left, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I know that. I want to come
upstairs.”</p>

<p>“Fourth floor, Lieutenant—automatic lift.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>The release mechanism on the door was already
clicking. Lieutenant Valcour entered a smart little
lobby and then an electric lift. He pressed the button
for the fourth floor.</p>

<p>“Sorry to bother you like this,” he said, as he
stepped out into a private foyer, and stared curiously
at the young man facing him.</p>

<p>“No trouble at all, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“That’s very kind of you, Mr.——”</p>

<p>“Smith, Lieutenant—Jerry Smith.”</p>

<p>“Since when?” asked Lieutenant Valcour gently,
as he started to follow Mr. Smith into an adjoining
room.</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>The man stopped, and his soft dark eyes stared
earnestly at Lieutenant Valcour from a ruddy,
slightly dissipated-looking young face.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour removed his hat and placed it
on a settee. “Nothing much, Mr. Smith,” he said.
“Certainly nothing beyond the fact that I saw you
one morning last month in the line-up down at
headquarters. In connection with some night-club business,
I believe. The charge fell through, I also believe,
because the woman involved preferred the loss of her
emerald necklace to the loss of prestige she certainly
would have suffered during the publicity of a trial
had she pressed the case. That’s all I mean, Mr.
Smith.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose, sir, I could convince you of my
innocence?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose you could.”</p>

<p>“It was my misfortune that the case never did
come to trial, Lieutenant. I could have cleared myself
then.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. You could have brought counter
charges—sued for damage for false arrest.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith looked inexpressibly shocked. “We of
the South, sir, do not bring charges against a lady.”</p>

<p>“Well, the ethical distinction between swiping a
woman’s necklace and bringing charges against her
is a shade too delicate for my Northern nerves to
grasp.” Lieutenant Valcour crossed casually to a
chair placed before a secretary and sat down. “Sit
down, Mr. Smith,” he said, “and tell me something
about your friend Thomas.”</p>

<p>“The straightest, squarest gentleman who ever
lived, sir. Why . . .” Mr. Smith plunged into a
panegyric that would have brought a blush even to the
toughened cheek of a Caligula.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour permitted him to plunge.
While the flood poured into his ears, his eyes were
inconspicuously busied with such papers as were on
view in the secretary.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p><span class="sc">Tom, darling</span>
  [he read on the folded half of a sheet of notepaper]:
  Let’s tea on Thursday at the Ritz. 4:30, as Herbert . . .</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour did not consider it essential to
reach out and turn the page. His fingers absently
busied themselves with the leather sheath for,
presumably, a metal paper cutter or, perhaps, a stiletto.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is an honourable and an upright gentleman,
sir, and if you think there is anything wrong
with him in the Endicott business”—Mr. Smith
temporarily moved north of the Mason and Dixon
Line—“you’re all wet.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was through.</p>

<p>“For how long has he known Endicott, Mr.
Smith?”</p>

<p>“As I’ve been telling you, Lieutenant, ever since
that night he saved Endicott’s life.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour became almost embarrassing
in the sudden focussing of his attention. “Would it
bother you very much, Mr. Smith, to tell me of that
occurrence again?”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s just as I’ve been <em>saying</em>, Lieutenant,
in the war—the war.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course. Endicott and Hollander were in
the same outfit, and Hollander saved Endicott’s
life.”</p>

<p>“You can prove it, sir, if you wish. Just call up
the Bronx armoury and ask for the adjutant—in the
morning, of course, as he wouldn’t be there now.
He’ll make it official.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I believe it all right, Mr. Smith. It’s a very
reasonable explanation of why Endicott should be so
intimate with one of your friends.”</p>

<p>“I swear you have me wrong, Lieutenant. I had
no more to do with that gilt-knuckles job than—”
Mr. Smith sought desperately for a convincing
simile—“than a babe unborn.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t any of my business anyway, Mr. Smith,
even if you had,” said Lieutenant Valcour soothingly.
He tapped the leather sheath he was holding against
his fingers. “I suppose Hollander was even quite
prominent at the wedding, when Endicott was
married?”</p>

<p>“Prominent? He was the best man.”</p>

<p>“Really. Well, well. Mrs. Endicott is indeed a
very beautiful woman, and from all that she has told
me, a much misunderstood one.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith poised himself delicately upon the fence
and remained watchful.</p>

<p>“It must have been rather a problem for Hollander,”
Lieutenant Valcour went on reflectively,
“when she told him this afternoon during their tea
at the Ritz that she was faced with one of two
things.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he tell you?”</p>

<p>“Tell me what, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“That Mrs. Endicott told him she couldn’t stand
it any longer: that she either was going to kill her
husband or else commit suicide.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith smothered a sharp intaking of breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know how women talk, Lieutenant. It’s
just talk.”</p>

<p>“Then he wasn’t impressed, really?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course not. No more so than you or I
would have been.”</p>

<p>“He got back here from the Ritz at six?”</p>

<p>“About.”</p>

<p>“And stayed here until I ’phoned him?”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith looked a little baffled. “Well, not
exactly, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Just how exactly, Mr. Smith?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see, he left for dinner right after he
came in.”</p>

<p>“Just after six?”</p>

<p>“Near six-thirty.”</p>

<p>“And what time did he get back from dinner?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t here, Lieutenant. I had a date and
didn’t get back here myself until around midnight.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour became very, very casual.</p>

<p>“Did Hollander plan to marry Mrs. Endicott after
she’d got the divorce?” he said.</p>

<p>“Golly, no. There wasn’t going to be any divorce.
It was platonic—and damned if I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite possible.”</p>

<p>“I have never seen her—but to hear Tom rave!”</p>

<p>“She is very beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant,” Mr. Smith’s exceedingly attractive
dark eyes stared solemnly into Lieutenant Valcour’s
veiled ones, “he thinks she’s a saint. I mean it.”</p>

<p>“Dark and strange,” muttered Lieutenant
Valcour. “Dark and strange.”</p>

<p>“What’s dark and strange, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“The rather terrible things that sometimes happen,
Mr. Smith, under the patronage of love.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be damned if you talk like a cop,” said Mr.
Smith, suddenly very suspicious.</p>

<p>“Then I’m afraid you are damned, Mr. Smith.
What,” Lieutenant Valcour asked suddenly, “was
kept in this?”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith, momentarily distracted from his suspicions
by the abrupt switch, stared at the leather
sheath Lieutenant Valcour was holding out at him.</p>

<p>“Some sort of a sticker that Tom picked up on
the other side,” he said. “Damascus steel, he calls
it. Uses it for a paper knife.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why it isn’t in its sheath,” said
Lieutenant Valcour mildly.</p>

<p>“Search me.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour poked around among the
papers.</p>

<p>“It isn’t here in this secretary, either.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know where it is, Lieutenant. It
was there this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where it is either, Mr. Smith, but
I’m going to find out.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Where was it you saw it this afternoon? On this
secretary?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour’s search of the secretary was
swift and thorough. The pigeonholes, the drawers
yielded no stiletto of Damascus steel. Hidden in one
of the drawers was a copy of the <i>Oxford Book of
English Verse</i>. That interested him momentarily. He
gave it sufficient attention to note that the most used
portion included the Sonnets of Shakespeare. But
there was no time now—no time.</p>

<p>“I’m going through the rooms here,” he said, “and
look for that stiletto.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be exceeding your authority if you do,
Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Have you any objections?” Lieutenant Valcour
asked quietly.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith grew almost fervent in his protestations
that he had none. Why should he? He had nothing to
conceal, nor had Hollander. Of course, there were a
bottle or two of gin and a quart of Scotch, but he
didn’t imagine the lieutenant would be interested in
anything along that line. No, the lieutenant assured
him, he wouldn’t be. Liquor was not in his province.
Then it would be all right to go ahead and search?
Lieutenant Valcour wanted to know. Oh, quite.</p>

<p>In spite of his verbal acquiescence Mr. Smith
followed Lieutenant Valcour through the two other
rooms of the apartment with a gradually growing air
of truculence. He stood near and a little behind him
when, after the search yielded nothing, Lieutenant
Valcour went to a telephone and dialled the
Endicotts’ number.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour did not get the connection,
because Mr. Smith drew a pliable leather-bound slug
of lead from his pocket and struck Lieutenant
Valcour with it on the head.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch15">

<h2>Chapter XV. <br> 2:13 a. m.—The Thin Steel Blade</h2>

<p>Miss Murrow began to feel fidgety.</p>

<p>Even after the many, many years she had spent in
nursing she had never accustomed herself to spending
a night quite comfortably in a chair. She had always
had her attacks of the fidgets, and would probably
continue to have them until she arrived at the port
of destination for all good nurses and married one
of her patients or a doctor. Of the two she really
preferred a patient.</p>

<p>She trained a speculative eye on her present one
over there on the bed. Not really speculative, as—she
told herself firmly—he was already married.
Although heaven knew that that never mattered. Take
the case of that red-headed Gilford girl who had
snapped old man Tomlinson right up from under his
wife’s nose—probably, at that, because of his wife’s
nose, which had been an unusually large one. Miss
Murrow giggled. That was almost witty enough to
tell to Mr. Hollander.</p>

<p>He must have <em>felt</em> that she was thinking about him.
What a curious expression that was in his eyes. He
had just turned them toward her, and they seemed
to glitter. Yes, that was the word
exactly—“glitter.”</p>

<p>It was a fancy of Miss Murrow’s to be meticulous
in the matter of words. “Really,” she thought, “I
don’t see why I couldn’t be an author.” She felt sure
she had ever so much more knowledge of life than one
encountered in the average run of books. Tripe. Yes,
“tripe” was indeed the word. Of course, her books
wouldn’t be average. Now that little story of Delia
Hackenpoole and the interne with those shifty
eyes . . .</p>

<p>Eyes . . .</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Hollander’s eyes <em>were</em> glittering—even
in that second flash she had just caught of them.
But possibly he, too, had the fidgets. He’d been sitting
terribly quiet for the past ten minutes or so. Not a
budge out of him. A body would forget he was there,
almost.</p>

<p>Of course he was handsome. Especially in that soft,
vague light from the distant lamp which picked his
pale features out obscurely. And they <em>were</em> pale, at
that. Genuinely pale. She did hope he wasn’t
going to be ill or have a nervous breakdown and
ruin this perfectly marvellous case of the dear
doctor’s. . . .</p>

<p>Mrs. Sanford Worth. What a pleasant name it
would be. <i>Distingué</i>. How apt the French were! (She
knew ten phrases.)</p>

<p>Was that right hand of Mr. Hollander’s actually
moving, or was it an illusion of light and shade? It
seemed to be slipping slowly from the arm of the
chair and would eventually end up in his lap. It was
moving—it wasn’t—quite creepy, really. Damn the
fidgets! She shifted her centre of balance and felt
temporarily relieved. Overstuffed chairs were really
wretched for prolonged periods of sitting, when you
came right down to it, whereas a good old-fashioned
horsehair sofa, such as Aunt Helen had had at
Sciota. . . .</p>

<p>Why, the hand was gone!</p>

<p>Positively gone—like a conjuring trick.</p>

<p>It wasn’t on the arm of the chair, so it must be in
Mr. Hollander’s lap. Then it <em>had</em> been moving after
all, and she hadn’t been just imagining it. Why, it
was almost <em>sneaky</em>. . . .</p>

<p>His profile was toward her. Not a snub nose, exactly,
nor <i>retroussé</i>. You couldn’t apply that term to
anything about a man, and whatever else he might
be, Mr. Hollander certainly was a man.</p>

<p>How interesting his life at sea must have been.
(She had definitely ticketed him as a sailor.) Lives
at sea were always interesting. All the best books
were in accord with that. You never read of a Main
Street on the ocean. What with the girls in every
port and the fights and the smell of crisp salt air . . .
What a wretched little twirp that boy had been down
at the beach last summer, with his absurd remarks
about the salt smell being a lot of decayed lobster
pots and dead fish. Of course the air at sea was salt.
Sea and salt were synonymous.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollander <em>did</em> have the fidgets.</p>

<p>She couldn’t see exactly, because of the masking
arm of the chair, but he certainly was fiddling with
something. She’d think he was twirling his thumbs,
if he looked like the sort of man who twirled thumbs,
but he didn’t, so it wasn’t that.</p>

<p>She looked at her wrist watch and saw that the
hands were approaching the half hour. She’d have to
examine her patient and note his pulse on the chart.
What a pity that the only time you really felt
comfortable in an overstuffed chair was at the moment
when you had to get up.</p>

<p>She stood up, smoothed starched surfaces, and
sailed, a smart white pinnace, toward the bed. She
smiled engagingly at Mr. Hollander and then started
to take Endicott’s pulse. She gave a slight start and
concentrated her full attention upon Endicott.</p>

<p>“I think there’s a change.”</p>

<p>Hollander looked up at her alertly. “Change?”</p>

<p>“I think he shows signs of coming to.”</p>

<p>Miss Murrow wondered a moment at the tight
little lines which suddenly appeared on Hollander’s
face, hardening and aging it rather shockingly, and
altering the features into a cast whose hidden
significance she could not define exactly. Strain, perhaps,
better than anything else, served as an explanation:
an emotional strain.</p>

<p>“How can you tell?” he said.</p>

<p>Miss Murrow smiled a bit superiorly. “It becomes
instinct, mostly.”</p>

<p>“Will it be soon?”</p>

<p>“Very soon now. Be careful, please, not to disturb
him or make any sudden noise or movement until
I come back. I want Dr. Worth to be on hand before
the patient actually does regain consciousness.”</p>

<p>“You going up to get him now?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” She went over to the bathroom door and
spoke to Cassidy. “You gentlemen will be careful,
won’t you, about being seen? I’d stay well back within
the doorway, as sometimes a patient is a little, well,
wild when he comes to like this, and if he started
jerking around at all he might see you.” She smiled
engagingly. “What with the uniforms and
everything——”</p>

<p>Miss Murrow left implications of the possible fatal
consequences hanging in air and returned to Endicott.
She examined him critically for another moment,
checked his pulse again, and then started for the
door. She stopped just before she reached it, and said
to Hollander: “I suppose you had better lock the
door after me. Lieutenant Valcour placed great
stress on the fact that it should be kept locked
constantly.”</p>

<p>“I’ll lock it,” said Hollander.</p>

<p>“It does seem kind of foolish, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>Hollander smiled grimly. “Most foolish.”</p>

<p>He stood up and joined her at the door. She went
outside. He closed the door and locked it. He stared
almost blankly for an instant at the two policemen.
They had drawn their chairs back a little within the
bathroom doorway. Hansen was impassively studying
the ceiling above his head. Cassidy, leaning forward
a little, was looking with solemn eyes at the outline
of Endicott’s still figure beneath the bedclothes.</p>

<p>Hollander stretched cramped muscles and then
went back to his armchair beside the bed. He sat
down and was all but completely obscured from the
two guards by its high back. With imperceptible
movements he drew a thin steel blade from beneath
the cuff of his left coat sleeve and held it in such a
fashion that it was masked in the palm of his right
hand, the hilt extending up a little beneath the shirt
cuff. He leaned forward and stared down upon Endicott’s
quiet face. Not quiet, exactly, for the lids were
twitching—opening—and Endicott’s eyes, bright and
unseeing from fever, stared up. . . .</p>

<h2>Chapter XVI. <br> 2:13 a. m.—Time <i>versus</i> Death</h2>

<p>O’Brian stirred a bit restlessly in his chair by the
hall door and yawned; then he looked at his watch.
It was almost a quarter past two. He began to enumerate
the various things he would give for a good cup
of strong black coffee, and his shirt headed the list.
Or, if not coffee, some excitement to keep him awake.</p>

<p>The telephone jangled.</p>

<p>He stood up abruptly and went to the instrument.
It would be, he imagined, Lieutenant Valcour calling
again to find out if everything was all right. Well,
everything was.</p>

<p>O’Brian lifted the receiver and said, “Hello!”</p>

<p>No one answered him, and there wasn’t any sound
from the other end of the line, unless you could call
a sort of thumping noise and a faint tinkle that might
have been breaking glass a sound.</p>

<p>“Hello!” O’Brian said again.</p>

<p>The line wasn’t dead, because there wasn’t that
peculiar burring one hears when the connection is
broken. The receiver of the ’phone at the other end
was certainly off the hook. O’Brian singled out one
of the patron saints of Ireland and wanted to know,
most emphatically, just what sort of fun and foustie
was being made of him.</p>

<p>“Hello!” He tried it again.</p>

<p>There was a click. The burring sound started. The
line was dead. Whoever had been calling from the
other end had hung up.</p>

<p>O’Brian very thoughtfully did likewise.</p>

<p>Then he began to wonder what he ought to do. It
didn’t take him very long to decide, especially as the
thumping noise and tinkle of breaking glass grew
louder in retrospect the more he thought about them.
He didn’t have to go as far as Denmark; something
was certainly rotten right here in New York.</p>

<p>He dialled the operator, identified himself as a
member of the police force, and stated that he wanted
the call he had just received instantly traced.</p>

<p>“Oneminuteplease,” requested a voice with a
macadamized smile.</p>

<p>The minute stretched into two—ten—but eventually
he was informed that the call had come from
the apartment of a Mr. Thomas Hollander, whose
’phone number and address were thereupon given.</p>

<p>O’Brian jotted them down. He then dialled the
telephone number of Hollander who was, as he very
well knew, right upstairs. Several persistent diallings
failed to awaken any response.</p>

<p>The complexion of the work afoot grew dirtier.
O’Brian felt certain that it was connected with the
terrain activities of Lieutenant Valcour. If it had
just been some occupant of Hollander’s apartment
who had wanted to call Hollander up about
something, there would have been an answer.</p>

<p>And there wouldn’t have been that thumping noise,
and the tinkle of breaking glass.</p>

<p>It seemed a matter that required investigation at
once. O’Brian telephoned his precinct station and
reported the occurrence and his beliefs about it to
the sergeant in charge. He was assured that a raiding
squad would be dispatched within a matter of
minutes to the address he had given.</p>

<p>One was.</p>

<p>They found Lieutenant Valcour helplessly bound,
very dazed, very weak, lying on the floor beneath a
table when the men crashed the door to Hollander’s
apartment and broke in. Cold water—a glass of
whiskey from a convenient decanter—and intelligence
and strength began to return. Lieutenant Valcour
pushed away the hands that were supporting
him and, going to the telephone, called the Endicotts’.</p>

<p>“O’Brian?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lieutenant—you all right, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes—pay attention to every word I say and
follow my instructions to a letter. Endicott’s life
depends upon it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Go upstairs to Dr. Worth and wake him. Tell
him I believe that Hollander is armed with a knife
and that he is probably just waiting for a chance to
use it when he won’t be observed by the nurse or
Cassidy and Hansen. Hollander is Endicott’s enemy,
not friend. Tell Dr. Worth to go down and knock on
Endicott’s door. Tell him to go right inside when it
opens. Now get this.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Tell him to ask the nurse how the patient is—to
act natural about it. Tell him to start to go out
and then, as a second thought, tell him to beckon to
Hollander as if he wanted to tell Hollander something.
Hollander will get up and go to him. Tell him
to whisper to Hollander that there’s something he
wants to tell him privately, if Hollander will step
outside for a minute into the corridor. You be in the
corridor. When Hollander comes out, jump him.
Put the cuffs on him and keep him quiet until I get
there. I’ll be right on up. O. K.?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour rang off. He turned to the
sergeant in charge of the detail.</p>

<p>“Leave one man here, Sergeant,” he said. “The
rest of you men can go back to the station after
you’ve dropped me at the Endicotts’.”</p>

<p>“Anything you want the man who’s left here to do,
Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Not unless a dark-haired youngster comes back,
which he won’t. But if he should, just have him kept
for me, please, on ice.”</p>

<p>Down on the street, Lieutenant Valcour jumped in
beside the driver of the department car and said,
“Step on it, Clancy. It’s only eleven blocks up and
three west.”</p>

<p>The car shot forward, swept to the right at the
corner, and lunged up Lexington Avenue. There was
little traffic, and what little there was was so scattered
that nothing impeded its way.</p>

<p>“Something going to break on that Endicott
business, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Either going to, or has.”</p>

<p>“A homicide, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Possibly—by now.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Nurse Murrow smoothed the last wrinkles from
her uniform while waiting for Dr. Worth to open the
door. It paid to look one’s best. Always, at any time
at all. One never could tell.</p>

<p>“Oh, Doctor. I’m sorry to get you up again so
soon, but Mr. Endicott shows symptoms of coming
to.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth, who was no longer the eager-eyed
practitioner he once had been, did his best to shake
off the puffy chains of sleep.</p>

<p>“I’ll come right down, Miss Murrow.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Just want to dash some cold water on my face.”</p>

<p>“No hurry, Doctor.”</p>

<p>He vanished into the room again. Ah, dreamed
Miss Murrow, <em>what</em> a man! And he’d never been
snappy with her, either. So many were snappy.
Someone was coming up the stairs—quickly—two at
a time—a policeman——</p>

<p>“Where’s the doctor, miss?” said O’Brian, a little
winded.</p>

<p>“He’s coming right out, Officer.”</p>

<p>“I gotta see him at once.”</p>

<p>O’Brian brushed her aside and opened the door.
Dr. Worth met him, astonished and glistening, on
the threshold.</p>

<p>“Say, lissen, Doctor, the lieutenant just called up,
and he said . . .”</p>

<p>O’Brian thereupon repeated all that the lieutenant
had said.</p>

<p>“But, my dear man, this is the most extraordinary
thing I have ever heard in my life!” Dr. Worth’s
slightly damp eyebrows indulged in a series of
gyrations.</p>

<p>“Sure there ain’t no time for astonishments,
Doctor,” said O’Brian. “Let’s go—easy and quietlike,
now. We’re not to put this bird wise. . . .”</p>

<p>With O’Brian leading, they started down the
stairs.</p>

<hr>

<p>“Hello, Herb,” Hollander said softly.</p>

<p>Endicott’s voice was so weak that it scarcely
carried to Hollander’s ears. “Who is it?” he said.
“What . . .” the voice dribbled off.</p>

<p>“It’s your friend, Herb.”</p>

<p>Sullen, petulant lines clung suddenly to Endicott’s
mouth, making the thickish lips look almost viciously
weak. He made a curious noise that might have been
intended for a laugh.</p>

<p>“Have no friend.” The voice was the ghost of dead
whispers.</p>

<p>“What happened to you, Herb?”</p>

<p>“Happened?” Endicott’s eyes made a strong effort
to get through the fogs shrouding them. “Something
did happen—I want the police—I’ll teach that
rotten—that——”</p>

<p>There wasn’t any sound for a while.</p>

<p>“You’ll teach whom, Herb?”</p>

<p>Endicott was staring very fixedly up at Hollander
now. And Hollander’s right hand, the fingers of which
were unnaturally rigid, was gently moving to that
spot on the spread which would lie above Endicott’s
heart.</p>

<p>“Who is it you’re going to teach, Herb?”
Hollander said again.</p>

<p>The mists were clearing, and Endicott could see
things almost plainly. He fixed Hollander’s face
into definite focus. “God damn you,” he said, “for
a——”</p>

<p>“Now, now, Herb, that isn’t nice, and you don’t
know what you’re saying.”</p>

<p>Hollander’s right hand had found the spot. It hung
above it, motionless, very rigid, and the fingers very
stiff.</p>

<p>“I’m going to call a policeman and——”</p>

<p>Endicott’s voice was so weak as to be almost
inaudible. His lips seemed as motionless as the rest of
his body, which was completely inert.</p>

<p>“No, you’re not, Herb,” whispered Hollander.
“And you’re not going to tell, either.”</p>

<p>Endicott got tired of looking up at Hollander.
His eyes travelled fretfully along Hollander’s right
arm.</p>

<p>“Neither you nor all the devils in hell,” he
whispered faintly, “can stop me from telling.”</p>

<p>And then he saw the knife.</p>

<p>“Can’t I, Herb?”</p>

<p>It was the slenderest knife Endicott had ever seen.
He wondered where on earth Hollander had got it.
No hilt—or perhaps the hilt was cupped in Hollander’s
hand. A stiletto, that’s what it was, and its
point was pressing through the white spread at a
point that lay just above his heart. Why, if the
pressure kept on, it would go right into his heart. . . .</p>

<p><em>Crack</em> . . .</p>

<p><em>Crack</em> . . . <em>crack crack</em> . . . <em>crack</em> . . . <em>crack</em> . . .</p>

<p>A bullet from Cassidy’s gun shattered Hollander’s
right wrist. Hansen’s shot caught him in the right
shoulder. Two bullets out of the fusillade that
followed lodged, one in his right hip, and the other one
farther down in the leg. Both officers, in spite of Nurse
Murrow’s orders, had moved into the room and were
crouched on the floor where they would still be
concealed from Endicott’s line of vision, but where they
could better and more closely observe what had been
the faintly suspicious movements on the part of
Hollander.</p>

<p>They were within four or five feet of him and still
crouched below him as blood stained the white spread
in a sickish smear when Hollander dragged his
mangled wrist across it to the floor.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch17">

<h2>Chapter XVII. <br> 2:40 a. m.—The Angle of Death’s Path</h2>

<p>The pounding on the door became hysterical, and
Cassidy, who for two cents would have become
hysterical himself, went over and unlocked it. He found
Dr. Worth, backed by scandalously excited servants
and flanked by Nurse Murrow and O’Brian, pressing
across the sill.</p>

<p>“Is it Endicott?” Dr. Worth demanded
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“No, sir—it’s Hollander. We shot the knife from
his hand before he could stick it into Endicott, and
then we shot him down.”</p>

<p>“Close this door, Officer, and keep these people
out. Come in with me, Miss Murrow.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth came into the room with Nurse Murrow.
Cassidy closed the door, and the shrill clatter of
excited whisperings ebbed like a tide.</p>

<p>“Thank God, Officer, you saved Endicott. What a
mess.” Dr. Worth glanced critically at Hollander,
huddled on the floor by the bed in a blood-soaked
heap. “You two men help Nurse Murrow. Stretch
him out on that chest over there by the window.
Do what you can for him, Miss Murrow, until I’ve
taken care of Endicott.”</p>

<p>Cassidy and Hansen lifted Hollander and carried
him to the improvised cot Miss Murrow arranged
with blankets and a pillow on top of the mahogany
chest by the window.</p>

<p>Nurse Murrow then became the acme, the pink of
proficiency. She dressed and bound Hollander’s
wounds, and applied the proper tourniquet above his
shattered wrist. In her opinion, his condition was not
fatally serious, when one considered his obvious
physique and his probably excellent constitution—of
iron—and, yes, he <em>was</em> distinctly handsome. What a
pity they’d arrest him. Or perhaps he was under
arrest already, although she usually associated
handcuffings with arrests. But there surely wouldn’t be
any handcuffs now. In spite of her long familiarity
with dreadful injuries she shuddered a little at that
shattered wrist. And they couldn’t be so soulless as
to move him to prison. Dr. Worth would never permit
any patient of his to be treated like that. And, after
all, Hollander <em>was</em> the doctor’s patient. . . .</p>

<p>Dr. Worth himself was standing beside her. There
was a bewildered, curiously grave look on his face.
She sensed intuitively what had happened.</p>

<p>“Mr. Endicott, Doctor?”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth shrugged helplessly. “He’s dead.”</p>

<p>“But I swear that knife never went in, sir,” Cassidy
said. “Hansen, here, and me was watching Hollander
like cats. Sure we saw the knife even before it
touched the bedclothes.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t Hollander have a gun, too?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because Endicott was killed by a bullet.”</p>

<p>Hansen’s Nordic young face grew very red and
then very white. Cassidy showed nothing of what he
was thinking—certainly nothing of the sickening,
puzzled worry that clamped his chest—except that
there was a tight clenching of his hands.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” Cassidy said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Dr. Worth, “it is too bad.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure, sir?”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth grew icily formal. “Quite,” he said.
He was also getting good and mad. This was the sort
of thing, he told himself angrily, that taxpayers
shelled out their money for. Protection! It was
enough to make anybody laugh. A lot of protection
the police force of New York City had been for
Endicott. They’d shot him—that’s what.</p>

<p>“But I don’t see how——”</p>

<p>“Officer, there is no mistaking the difference
between a bullet wound and one made by a knife. In
this case especially it is perfectly obvious. I dare say
the charge against you two men will be just
technical—accidental homicide in line of duty!”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth did permit himself one short laugh.</p>

<p>“I guess so, Doctor,” Cassidy said.</p>

<p>“And is there anything that has to be done,
Officer?”</p>

<p>“In what way, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, a report made to the medical examiner?”
Dr. Worth became almost airy in his mounting anger.
“This sort of starts the whole thing over again,
doesn’t it? I mean, won’t the medical examiner have
to come back up and investigate before we can move
the body and—oh, well, you know the line.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so, sir.” Cassidy’s face was the colour of a
red tile brick. “Cripes, but I wish the lieutenant was
here.”</p>

<p>“I understand that he will be here any minute.”</p>

<p>“You’ve heard from him, sir?”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth felt that if he didn’t apply the brakes
he would become positively light-headed. “Oh, yes,
yes, indeed, Officer. He called up to warn me that my
patient was going to be murdered and suggested that
I run downstairs and stop it. Murder? Fiddlesticks—it’s
beginning to graduate into a catastrophe.”</p>

<p>“What has happened here?”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour, very pale, still very weak,
and with an improvised bandage around his head,
had come unobserved into the room.</p>

<p>“You can see,” Dr. Worth said with almost
insulting distinctness, “for yourself.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth then went on to expand. He related in
detail his version of the battle—he insisted that it
was a battle—which had just taken place.</p>

<p>Entirely apart from the natural discomfiture of his
head, Lieutenant Valcour was feeling desperately
glum. Under no light, no matter how favourable,
could his handling of the case be considered a success.
He had to his credit one slap on the face, a good
crack on the head from a lead slug, and now it seemed
that the very man whom they had been ordered to
guard had been shot and killed by his own men. That,
at least, was the impression the angry bee talking to
him was obviously trying to give. Oh, it would be a
<i>cause célèbre</i> all right, but he shuddered to think of
just what it would be celebrated for.</p>

<p>“This,” he said, “is nonsense.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth was by now thoroughly acid.</p>

<p>“I am glad that you are able to find in the miserable
situation some element of humour, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Humour? Not humour, Doctor. I am just trying
to say that the probability of Endicott’s having been
shot by one of my men is nonsense.”</p>

<p>“Would it convince you, sir, were I to remove
the bullet and let it speak for itself? Imperfections in
the barrel leave their markings, don’t they? You
can then doubtless determine which one of these two
young men fired the unhappy shot.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t get irritated, Doctor. I’m not trying
to annoy you or to be funny. It’s simply that I cannot
see—just where is the wound located, Doctor?”</p>

<p>“In the chest.”</p>

<p>“Cassidy, where were you and Hansen standing?”</p>

<p>“We was crouched on the floor just inside the
room, sir—not over five feet off from Hollander,”
Cassidy said.</p>

<p>“Then consider your angles, Doctor. There’s
Endicott—there’s about where my men were crouched.
It would take pretty wild shooting for either of them
to hit Endicott in the chest. In fact, one might almost
consider it impossible.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth still hovered around zero. “From the
number of innocent bystanders whom one reads
about in the newspapers as having been shot down
by the police——”</p>

<p>“That is an unfair comparison, Doctor. Those
cases you refer to have all involved a chase of some
sort—rapid motion—streets cluttered up with people.
There was nothing like that here. I’m going to call up
Central Office and ask permission for you to remove
the bullet and determine the angle of its path.”</p>

<p>“Permission, sir? And do you think it is my business
or my pleasure to go probing about for bullets
and determining the angles of their paths? I happen
to be a specialist, sir——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Doctor. But right now it is your business
to do just that. We must have the information
immediately.”</p>

<p>“And why so, sir?”</p>

<p>“Because if the calibre of the bullet that killed
Endicott differs from the ones in the guns of my
men, or if the angle of its course proves conclusively
that it could not have been fired by one of them, then
the murderer is still loose about the house. He couldn’t
have escaped, you see, as the guards are still on duty
down below.”</p>

<p>. . . Then the murderer is still loose about the
house . . .</p>

<p>The chilling possibilities of the statement served a
good deal to cool Dr. Worth’s steaming indignation.
He was getting tired with being angry, anyway.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I have been impatient, Lieutenant.
You may be quite right, and I’ll be glad to help you
in any way that I can.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Doctor. I’ll telephone Central Office
from downstairs, as I want to instruct the men on
guard down there to be doubly careful. If you’d
care to start in probing it will be quite all right.
I’ll explain everything to the medical examiner. It’s
something, you see, that we must know. Cassidy, you
and Hansen are not to leave this room. Search both
it and Hollander for a gun.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour went out, and Dr. Worth
proceeded, with the aid of Nurse Murrow, to probe.</p>

<p>The room had an air about it of a shambles.
Cassidy and Hansen, having searched for a gun and
found none, leaned dispiritedly against the wall near
the chest on which Hollander was lying. They felt a
measured sense of relief—had felt it, in fact, from the
moment when Lieutenant Valcour had come into the
room. Each knew he could never have fired that shot
which had killed Endicott. And each was reasonably
certain that the other couldn’t have, either.</p>

<p>They could determine nothing from Dr. Worth’s
face as to how the examination was going. Neither of
them looked very closely at what he was doing. Their
wonderings ran along parallel lines: Hollander
couldn’t have had a gun or they’d have seen it or
found it during their recent search. None of their
shots could have gone so hopelessly wild as to have
hit Endicott. But somebody did have a gun, and
Endicott had been shot by it. But there had been
nobody in the room with Endicott except themselves
and Hollander. And Hollander couldn’t have had a
gun, or they’d have seen it . . . the perfect loop
continued on and on. Each made the circle in his thoughts
and then started in all over again. If Lieutenant
Valcour hadn’t reëntered the room, and if Dr. Worth
hadn’t just then extracted the bullet, they probably
would have gone mildly mad.</p>

<p>“Everything’s all right, Doctor,” Lieutenant
Valcour said. “The medical examiner was only too
pleased at your kindness in helping him out. He won’t
be up again to-night unless I send for him. He asked
me to thank you.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, Lieutenant.” Dr. Worth showed
considerable excitement. “You know, it’s surprising.
I don’t know much about the calibre of bullets, but
I think you’re right about the angle. Here’s the
bullet.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour inspected a leaden pellet
curiously and then slipped it into a pocket.</p>

<p>“It isn’t from one of our guns, Doctor,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m not surprised, Lieutenant—not surprised at
all. Because the angle it entered at—why, damn it,
Lieutenant, it must have been fired from some place
over there.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth indicated a problematic area which
included the corner where Hollander was stretched
out. Lieutenant Valcour looked just above
Hollander at the window. It was the window which had
been opened about six or seven inches from the
bottom by Nurse Murrow so that the air for her
patient would be quite fresh and clear.</p>

<p>It was still open.</p>

<p>And outside of it, as Lieutenant Valcour very well
knew, ran the shallow balcony which offered not only
adornment to the rear of the house but a passageway
to—and from—the windows of Mrs. Endicott’s room.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Endicott was under the influence of a
narcotic, and a nurse and a maid were both in the
room with her.</p>

<p>But were they? . . .</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch18">

<h2>Chapter XVIII. <br> 3:00 a. m.—Thin Haze of Dread</h2>

<p>Dr. Worth, too, was staring at the black, impenetrable
rectangle left by the opened window. It was a
passageway for air, but infinitely more so was it a
passageway leading to obscure recesses of the night:
recesses that seemed to offer a maleficent sanctuary
to hell-born secrets of distorted souls.</p>

<p>Who had crept along that balcony and fired that
shot?</p>

<p>The apparent improbability of anyone from Mrs.
Endicott’s room having done so transplanted the
problem from clear fields of logic and of simple facts
into vague regions of absurd conjecturings which
stared wanly out at Lieutenant Valcour through
baffling curtains of darkness and of fog.</p>

<p>He felt a definite sense of uncertainty, and—as one
does when confronted by a suggestion of the
unknown—an impalpable dread. It was nothing that he
could put his finger on; it seemed, absurdly, some
emanation from the outer night creeping in through
that rectangle of black to hang in thin hazes about
the room.</p>

<p>“What would you suggest doing with Hollander,
Doctor?” he said.</p>

<p>Dr. Worth, whose own thoughts had been warily
browsing in disagreeable pastures, sought relief in
professional preciseness.</p>

<p>“He would be better off in a hospital, Lieutenant.
I consider his constitution to be more than sufficiently
strong to obviate any danger in moving him. Are you
going to arrest him?”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour smiled faintly. “He is under
arrest now, Doctor. I should like to get a few things
straightened out, though, before booking him on
any definite charge. Would it hurt him very much to
talk with me before he is taken to the hospital?”</p>

<p>“Not if it weren’t for too long.”</p>

<p>“Could you give him something to revive him—to
brace him up?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Then I will have a man send for an ambulance,
and I’ll just talk with Hollander until it gets here.”</p>

<p>“That will be all right.”</p>

<p>“And if you don’t mind, Doctor, I should like to be
alone with him. Just he and I and—Endicott.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth was already busied with restoratives.
“Certainly,” he said. “Miss Murrow and I will be
outside, if you want to call us.”</p>

<p>“Cassidy,” Lieutenant Valcour said, “wait outside
in the hall, and you, Hansen, go downstairs and
telephone for an ambulance. Let me know as soon as
it gets here.”</p>

<p>And in a moment Lieutenant Valcour found himself
alone in the room with Endicott, with Hollander,
and with those curious mists that hinted at unnamed
dreads.</p>

<p>The restoratives were effective, and Hollander
opened his eyes upon a stranger who was sitting on a
chair beside the mahogany chest. He wondered idly
who the stranger was. The drug which Dr. Worth
had given him made him feel rather alert and smart.
Any sense of pain was completely deadened. His eyes
travelled leisurely about the room and hesitated at
a sheet-covered object on the bed. That would be his
friend called Endicott. His lids closed sharply as a
reaction to some wound that was not physical.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour stared thoughtfully down at
Hollander’s pale face.</p>

<p>“What did you do with Endicott’s hat?” he said.</p>

<p>Hollander opened his eyes again in bewilderment.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.
“And who are you, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I’m Lieutenant Valcour, Mr. Hollander. We’ve
talked together over the telephone. The hat I’m
referring to is the one that Endicott must have been
wearing, or carrying in his hand, or that was some
place near him when you attacked him shortly after
seven this evening.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t attack him, Lieutenant.” Hollander’s
lips were peaked-looking and didn’t move very much
when he talked. “I wasn’t in this house until a little
after one-thirty this morning—after you had called
me up.”</p>

<p>“Which did you think Mrs. Endicott would really
do, Mr. Hollander?”</p>

<p>Hollander tried painfully to concentrate. He felt
the need of being very careful of his footing: they
were on dangerous ground.</p>

<p>“Do?”</p>

<p>“Yes—when she told you during tea at the Ritz
that she had about reached the end and was either
going to kill Mr. Endicott or commit suicide. Or
didn’t you really believe either?”</p>

<p>It seemed impossible that Hollander’s face could
grow any paler.</p>

<p>“You’re crazy, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“All sorts of people tell me so lots of times, Mr.
Hollander. Did you have to wear Endicott’s hat
when you went out because you had lost your own?”</p>

<p>Hollander sighed fretfully. “You must think I’m
awfully dumb,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all—well, in a few things, yes. Your
choice of friends, for example. And I don’t mean the
Endicotts.”</p>

<p>“Whom do you mean, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“That dark-eyed child, for one—Mr. Smith. But
perhaps you don’t know that his name is not Smith.
I imagine that when you left him in the apartment he
was still either Jack Perry or Larry Nevins. He shows
great versatility, really, in his adoption of names. I
was just a little surprised and disappointed at his
present selection of Smith.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been to my apartment, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I had quite an enlightening talk with the
present Mr. Smith. Where did you leave Endicott’s
hat?”</p>

<p>Hollander, after one peevish glare, shut his eyes.</p>

<p>“I can tell you pretty well what happened, you
see, except for that,” Lieutenant Valcour went on.
“You <em>did</em> believe Mrs. Endicott this afternoon when
she told you her intention. That much is fact. And
now for a little fiction: either at the Ritz, or just as you
were handing her into her car, you stole her purse.”</p>

<p>Hollander’s eyes snapped open and glared viciously.</p>

<p>“Because,” Lieutenant Valcour continued, “you
wanted her keys—the keys to this house. You were a
little hazy as to just what it was you intended to do,
but you did know that you were going to kill Endicott,
and that you were going to do it before his wife
either committed suicide or killed him herself. You
went to your apartment and got the stiletto. Then
you came back here, let yourself in with Mrs. Endicott’s
keys, came up to this floor and into this room.
You may have been in several of the other rooms
first: I don’t know. Nor do I know just what you
were searching for while you waited in here, either.
Mrs. Endicott herself will tell me all about that
later. At any rate, you were going through Endicott’s
clothes in that cupboard when you heard him coming.
You closed the cupboard door. You were naturally
nervous and upset—everyone is when contemplating
or committing a crime. You were afraid there would
be some slip, so you disguised yourself with dust
smeared on your face. Then, either because you made
some noise or else because he wanted to get something
Endicott opened the cupboard door and saw you.
You must have had the stiletto all ready in your hand
and have looked pretty horrible altogether, because
the shock of seeing you stopped his heart and he
crumpled to the floor.”</p>

<p>Hollander’s eyes began to look feverish.</p>

<p>“His falling like that startled you,” went
on Lieutenant Valcour. “You felt his heart, and in
pulling open his overcoat so that you could get your
hand inside you ripped off the top button. What did
you do with it?”</p>

<p>Hollander grinned faintly. “Swallowed it,” he
said.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour flushed a little. “You probably
put it in your pocket. You were satisfied that
Endicott was dead—miraculously dead—and that you
hadn’t had to stab him. But he <em>was</em> dead, and you
experienced the natural panic of all murderers. I don’t
mean that you went wild, or anything. But your
mind didn’t function correctly. You may have been
quite calm, but it wasn’t a calmness based on
intelligence. You dragged Endicott into the cupboard
and closed the door. You washed the dirt from your
hands and face in the bathroom, combed and brushed
your hair, wiped the silver clean, and then printed
that curious note which Mrs. Endicott found, and
which contained no significance other than to direct
suspicion to some outside agency in order to shield
her from becoming a suspect herself. But why did
you take Endicott’s hat, and where did you put it?”</p>

<p>“You’re talking bunk, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, Mr. Hollander, those were the
moves which were made here to-night—whether you
were the person who made them or not.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And it is quite within the range of possibility
that if you didn’t make them, then Mrs. Endicott
did.”</p>

<p>Hollander looked very worried, very tired.</p>

<p>“You’re bluffing, Lieutenant,” he said.</p>

<p>“And you’re a very frightened man, Mr.
Hollander.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to arrest Mrs. Endicott?”</p>

<p>“That depends.”</p>

<p>“Because she didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t she, Mr. Hollander?”</p>

<p>“Because she loved her husband.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would explain to me how it is that she
loved him so much that she wanted either to commit
suicide or else kill him.”</p>

<p>“Pride, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour tested the possibility of that
angle. It could not, he felt, be ignored. As many
outrages were yearly committed under the goadings
of pride as there were committed because of jealousy
and hate.</p>

<p>“You believe, Mr. Hollander, that the other
women whom her husband played around with hurt
her pride so keenly that her love became coloured
with hate?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” A certain fierceness crept into Hollander’s
voice. His eyes were shining very brightly.
“People don’t know her as I know her. <em>Nobody</em>
knows her the way I know her.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour shrugged. “She made you
hate your friend—a man you’d been through the war
with—whose life you had saved.”</p>

<p>“That’s the bunk, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“But you did, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure, it’s all true enough, about it
happening—but that stuff doesn’t last.”</p>

<p>“Friendship?”</p>

<p>“Among men? Hell, no.” Hollander jerked his
head fretfully. “Gratitude gets damned tiresome,
Lieutenant, not only to give it but to get it.”</p>

<p>“Especially,” Lieutenant Valcour said gently, “if
a woman comes between.”</p>

<p>“No—no—no.”</p>

<p>There was a complete and very convincing finality
in the three negations.</p>

<p>“But you do love Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>“I worship her.”</p>

<p>“And she?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” There was nothing obscure in
Hollander’s expression now, and his eyes were frankly,
genuinely sincere. “Why should she? I’m nothing.
Herbert was everything.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour almost regretted having to do
so when he said, “Then why, Mr. Hollander, does she
address you in her notes as ‘Tom, darling’?”</p>

<p>Hollander didn’t answer for a minute. He considered
the question quite seriously. “I guess it’s just
because she’s sorry for me,” he said.</p>

<p>“And I, personally, think that that’s a pretty bum
guess.”</p>

<p>“No—listen here, Lieutenant . . .”</p>

<p>Hollander’s voice began to wander. His sentences
became broken—meaningless. It was with a sense of
relief that Lieutenant Valcour saw the door open and
two stretcher carriers come in followed by Dr. Worth
and the ambulance surgeon. Hollander, as they
carried him out, was unconscious again.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour detained Dr. Worth at the
door.</p>

<p>“There is something I should like to ask you,” he
said.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch19">

<h2>Chapter XIX. <br> 3:15 a. m.—The Properties of Horror</h2>

<p>“Doctor,” Lieutenant Valcour said, “our immediate
concern is to find out who fired that shot. The
principal reason is quite academic: we want to catch
and arrest the person who did it. A secondary reason
is that many people who reach the state of mental
unbalance where they are impelled to commit murder
don’t stop with the crime. They’ve tasted blood.
They are in a state of abnormal acuteness, and are
driven by a new fear: that of discovery and capture.
To prevent being captured, they reason, why not kill
again? There is nothing to be lost. You see, they can
only be electrocuted once. I am presupposing, of
course, that the criminal is an outsider—some person
at present hidden in the house, who will make some
desperate effort at escape. It is a supposition that
must be entertained, even though it is not a very good
one. I believe that the facts will eventually prove the
criminal to be a legitimate inmate.”</p>

<p>“That narrows the field, doesn’t it, Lieutenant, to
whoever was in Mrs. Endicott’s room?”</p>

<p>“It does, unless somebody dropped a rope ladder
from an upstairs window and got onto the balcony in
that way. But I don’t put much stock in those tricks,
Doctor, any more than I do in sliding panels and
trapdoors. Outside of the badger game I’ve never come
across a sliding panel in my life, and I don’t ever
expect to, either.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth was inclined to take the idea more
seriously. “But a rope ladder—there might very well
be one around the house for an emergency fire
escape.”</p>

<p>“All right, who was in the room just above this
one? You. Did you come down a rope ladder and
shoot Endicott?”</p>

<p>“God’s truth—my dear man——”</p>

<p>“Oh, be sensible, Doctor, of course you didn’t.
And who had the room across the hall from you,
which also is above the balcony? Mrs. Siddons, the
housekeeper. If you saw her, you’d scarcely picture
her as hurrying up and down a rope ladder. No,
Doctor, whoever was on that balcony came from Mrs.
Endicott’s room. We’re back to the same three people:
Mrs. Endicott, her maid, and her nurse.”</p>

<p>“But Mrs. Endicott is out of the question, Lieutenant.
She is still under the influence of the narcotic
I gave her.”</p>

<p>“How about the nurse, Doctor? Have you known
her long?”</p>

<p>“Known her? Only for the several cases she has
worked on with me. But she comes from the most
reputable agency in the city. How about the maid?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“She is just as good a candidate for suspicion as
Miss Vickers, isn’t she? Why under the sun should
Miss Vickers want to shoot Endicott?”</p>

<p>“I’m not seriously considering Miss Vickers at all.
It’s perfectly obvious that whoever did shoot Endicott
was either directly responsible for the earlier
attack during the evening or else involved in it as an
accomplice.”</p>

<p>“That might still include the maid.”</p>

<p>“It certainly might. I wonder if you’d mind asking
Miss Vickers to come in here. I’d like to question her
first.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth nodded toward Endicott’s body, covered
with a sheet on the bed. “Miss Vickers, Lieutenant,
being a nurse is naturally accustomed to seeing the
dead, but it will be rather gruesome for the maid if
you question her in here, too.”</p>

<p>“Very gruesome, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know best. You’re liable to have a
fine case of hysterics on your hands.”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk it.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth left and closed the door. There again
swept over Lieutenant Valcour, with the solitude,
that indefinable feeling of some lurking dread. There
were voices crying out to him from the subconscious,
warning him of dangers that were very real, very close
at hand—but the messages were indecisive, as are all
instinctive things which fall beyond the charted seas
of any human knowledge.</p>

<p>Nurse Vickers came in without the formality of
knocking. Her glance toward the bed was professional
and not coloured by any sign of nervousness.</p>

<p>“Thank you for coming, Miss Vickers. I’ll only
bother you for a minute.”</p>

<p>“No bother at all, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“There is just one thing I want to know: who was
in the room with you and your patient at the time of
the shooting?”</p>

<p>“Why, I couldn’t say, Lieutenant, exactly.”</p>

<p>“Why not, Miss Vickers?”</p>

<p>“Because I wasn’t there myself. I was down in the
kitchen making some coffee. I left Roberts with Mrs.
Endicott. You see, there wasn’t anything that had to
be done except just to be there. I’m sure it was quite
all right.”</p>

<p>“Of course it was. I’m not suggesting for a minute,
Miss Vickers, that I thought otherwise.” Lieutenant
Valcour studied the woman for a second and then
said, “I just wanted to know if you could help me
check up on the number of shots that were fired.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear any shots at all, Lieutenant, ’way
down there in that kitchen.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour wondered at this. The sound
of one shot might well have been heard down in the
kitchen: the shot which had killed Endicott and
which had been fired from the balcony. The sound
would surely have travelled clearly in the still night
air and to the kitchen from outside. And yet he
believed Nurse Vickers implicitly in her statement that
she had heard no shot. There was no earthly reason
why she should lie about it. The fact convinced him
that whoever had fired had held the pistol inside of
the window. He glanced at the sash and realized that
the opening afforded plenty of room for a hand
holding a gun to reach through.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “I suppose you couldn’t have
heard anything at all. Maybe Roberts can help me.
She was in the room, wasn’t she, when you came
back?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Lieutenant, and terribly excited about
the shooting. She seemed so upset, in fact, that if
there hadn’t been so many much more important
things for Dr. Worth to attend to, I’d have asked him
to give her something to quiet her.”</p>

<p>“One can hardly blame Roberts,” Lieutenant
Valcour said. “The fusillade must have been quite
a shock, you know. And then everyone’s nerves are
on edge to-night anyway. In just what fashion was
she upset, Miss Vickers? From your professional
experience, I mean, you probably could diagnose her
actions. Was it fright—nervous shock?”</p>

<p>“Oh, fright, of course, Lieutenant. I’ve seen lots
of nervous and hysterical people during my work but
never one as badly off as she was. I’m not exaggerating
one bit when I say that she was gripped with an
hysterical sort of terror.”</p>

<p>“Really. As bad as that?”</p>

<p>“Why, I was almost afraid even to let her stay in
the room with the patient. The poor creature actually
seemed to blame Mrs. Endicott in some fashion for
what had happened. Just imagine this, Lieutenant:
when I came in she was literally leaning over the bed
and shaking her fist at Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>“You are quite certain of this, Miss Vickers?”</p>

<p>“I saw it with my own eyes, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“And was Roberts saying anything?”</p>

<p>“Just the jumble that people go in for when they’re
hysterical.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t catch anything connected?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t try, Lieutenant. I had to get her away
from the bed and calm her down.”</p>

<p>“You were able to?”</p>

<p>“I was. She calmed down quite suddenly and became
perfectly normal again. I persuaded her to run
downstairs and make herself a good bracing cup of
tea.”</p>

<p>“Possibly carrying the pistol with her,” Lieutenant
Valcour thought bitterly, “to hide it in some place
where it might never be found.”</p>

<p>“Did she come back into the room afterward?” he
said.</p>

<p>“Well, not really, Lieutenant. I know how particular
you police officers are about the littlest details.
She just stopped at the door to tell me she was feeling
all right again. She said she was going upstairs to her
room to take a little rest.”</p>

<p>“And you’re quite sure, Miss Vickers, that you
can’t recall any of the words that Roberts was saying
when you found her leaning over the bed?”</p>

<p>“I would if I could, Lieutenant. It was just a
jumble. Ice—something about ‘ice and human
hearts.’ Then she switched to ‘searing flames’ and
I don’t know what all else.”</p>

<p>“Would it bother you very much to go up to her
room and see whether she’s in condition to come down
here for a few minutes?”</p>

<p>“Why, not at all. I’d be glad to.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Vickers. You’ve helped me
tremendously. Oh, there’s just one thing, Miss
Vickers.”</p>

<p>Miss Vickers paused at the doorway.</p>

<p>“Yes, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“When you came back upstairs from the kitchen,
did you notice anything about the atmosphere of
Mrs. Endicott’s room?”</p>

<p>“Why—I don’t know—you mean a sense of
tension or something?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. I mean was it as warm as when you
left it, or cooler, or what?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, too—it was cooler—<em>much</em>. Because I
remember after I quieted Roberts I went over to one
of the radiators to see if the heat was still turned on.
I thought Roberts must have turned it off, although
I couldn’t for the life of me see why. But the radiator
was quite hot, so I realized it must have been just
the change from the kitchen. It’s a hot kitchen.”</p>

<p>“That is probably just what it was. Would you
send Roberts to me now, please?”</p>

<p>“I will, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Miss Vickers went out and closed the door.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour then did a rather horrible
thing. He went over to the bed and pulled down
enough of the sheet so that Endicott’s face was
exposed.</p>

<p>And then he sat down and waited for Roberts.</p>

<h2>Chapter XX. <br> 3:24 a. m.—On Private Heights</h2>

<p>“You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>She <em>had</em> been under a strain, and a rather terrible
one. There wasn’t any doubt about that. It was
emotion, after all, that brought age, not years, thought
Lieutenant Valcour as he glanced at the dark rings
so clearly visible beneath her tragic eyes.</p>

<p>Roberts hadn’t looked toward the bed—yet—but
then he hadn’t really expected that she would. Perhaps
she wouldn’t look for some time, but eventually
she would lose some portion of that really splendid
self-control that she was exerting and then, instead of
the expanse of white sheet she had been expecting,
there would be Endicott’s face. . . .</p>

<p>“I wonder if you could tell me, Miss Roberts, the
number of shots that were fired during the shooting.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>She was pointedly on guard, her eyes held at a level
that included his cravat but went no higher.</p>

<p>“The question isn’t as silly a one as it seems,”
Lieutenant Valcour said. “I don’t suggest for a
minute that you counted the shots as they were being
fired, actually, but it’s quite within possibility that
your subconscious mind really did that very thing,
and that on consciously thinking about it the number
might come to you. It’s something along the principle
of visualizing sound.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I’m sure that no amount of thinking
about it would clear the rather terrible confusion of
that moment.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down?”</p>

<p>“I prefer to stand, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Just as you wish. You were with Mrs. Endicott,
weren’t you, when it happened?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour admired the accomplished ease
with which the word had so unhesitatingly been
brought out; but then most women, in his estimation,
were natural-born liars. The art formed for him one
of their greatest charms.</p>

<p>“You were sitting down beside the bed?” he went
on.</p>

<p>“Yes. Reading.”</p>

<p>Splendid—splendid—she was a Bernhardt—a Duse.</p>

<p>“And Miss Vickers?”</p>

<p>“She was down in the kitchen making some coffee.”</p>

<p>“Did the shooting upset you, Miss Roberts?”</p>

<p>“I’m naturally nervous. The sound of firing has
always disturbed me terribly.” Then she flung at him
abruptly, “My brother was killed in the war.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour both looked and felt genuinely
consoling. He also felt a selfish measure of irritation.
The statement was such a perfect period mark. When
a young woman, no matter how great a criminal,
potentially, announces flatly that her brother has
been killed during the war, one can’t ride over the
fact roughshod.</p>

<p>“Was there anyone whom you loved killed in the
war, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>She was determined to hammer at the point, it
seemed. He wished that she would stop.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t, Miss Roberts.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t know much about soldiers.”</p>

<p>“No, not much, really.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean soldiers—or the war itself, either.
It’s a state of being—a sort of lucid abnormality.
It’s hard to tell you just what I do mean. But it’s the
thing,” she ended fiercely, “that made me understand
Mr. Endicott. He never quite recovered, you
see, from being a soldier.”</p>

<p>“And perhaps it also made you understand why
Mrs. Endicott misunderstood him?”</p>

<p>Things were going better now; the channel was
broadening into useful seas.</p>

<p>“Of course it was,” Roberts said. “She, too, lost
no one in the war.”</p>

<p>The fog rolled in again.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m not following you very clearly.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite useless, Lieutenant—simply that in
Mr. Endicott I kept seeing my brother. I suffered for
him to the extent I would have suffered for my
brother had my brother been in similar
circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Suffered?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suffered. From her damned superiority.”</p>

<p>“You think that Mrs. Endicott overdid the
mental?”</p>

<p>He noted that Roberts was slowly losing control.
There was a blazing quality of anger creeping into
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, she regarded that man as her tame
tiger. You realize how strong he must have been
physically.”</p>

<p>“Very strong.”</p>

<p>“It used to please her to control him—you know
the way it’s commonly expressed—with a ‘word.’ ”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t exactly say that she had succeeded.”</p>

<p>“The other women?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t care about that. If anything, it satisfied
her sense of power. She looked on them as a pack
of shoddy substitutes that he could fool with, kick
around, and treat terribly, if he liked. But she still
remained the original—the unapproachable—the
happy possessor of a tame tiger. He was always <em>hers</em>,
you see, no matter what it was he had done. She’s had
him crying.”</p>

<p>“That’s a little hard to believe.”</p>

<p>“It’s the truth. He took her in his hands one night
and twisted her—just like that! She didn’t say a thing
to him. For a month afterward he went around the
house like a whipped cat. Then she said something
kind to him, and he cried. I wish she was in hell.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she is, Miss Roberts—just that.”</p>

<p>“She won’t stay in it long. Her kind doesn’t.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour held his eyes thoughtfully
directed toward the bed.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Miss Roberts, do you think that Mr.
Endicott is happier dead? Let me put it in this
fashion: if Mr. Endicott had really been your brother,
would you rather have seen him dead than living in
the emotional hell you picture Mr. Endicott as
having lived in?”</p>

<p>His gaze retained its determined fixity.</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “There is always a way out.” It
was irresistible. She found herself having to look, too.
Against every advice of instinct her eyes were drawn
toward the bed in company with Lieutenant
Valcour’s . . . peace—there <em>was</em> peace—greater than she
had ever seen when he had been living—peace to a
tired heart—a plain, normal, happy human heart
that had been broken on the wheel of too much
complexity. . . . “Oh, I’m lying, Lieutenant! I would—I
would—a million times rather.”</p>

<p>He worked very fast now, having captured the
mood. “Were you thinking of all that when you stood
outside on the balcony and watched him through the
window?”</p>

<p>Her eyes clung immovably to the cold closed lids,
the mouth, carved in gentle shadows; her very being
seemed withdrawn on private heights. “I wasn’t on
the balcony.”</p>

<p>“And I’d like to know what you did with the gun.”</p>

<p>. . . Perhaps he was laughing at it all now, if people
laugh in heaven. He and her brother. They would
have met and be laughing at it all together. But they
wouldn’t be laughing at her. . . . “There wasn’t any
need to use the gun, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Then what did you do with it?”</p>

<p>“Put it back in the bottom of my trunk.” . . . He’d
know, now, the exact reason why she had done the
things that she had done. People know everything in
heaven—sort of an enveloping awareness—like
lightning darting brilliantly to immediate
comprehension at its target—target—gun?—<em>gun</em>. Her face
was bleak ivory. “What did you say, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“I had just asked you, Miss Roberts, what you did
with the gun, and you told me that you put it back
again in the bottom of your trunk.”</p>

<p>Her eyes, as she looked at him, were strangely
devoid of fear.</p>

<p>“Then if I told you that, you’ll find it there.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t the wisest place to put it, Miss Roberts.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter much.”</p>

<p>“You mean you don’t care?”</p>

<p>“Not just that. I’m speaking about the gun. I
never fired it.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you hide it?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s illegal to have a gun.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you have one, Miss Roberts?”</p>

<p>“It’s one my brother gave me over twelve years
ago. I’ve always kept it with me.”</p>

<p>“What calibre is it?”</p>

<p>“A Colt .38.”</p>

<p>The bullet in Lieutenant Valcour’s pocket had been
fired from a Colt .38.</p>

<p>“And to-night you were going to use it to save Mr.
Endicott by shooting him.”</p>

<p>“No, Lieutenant. I was going to use it to shoot
Mrs. Endicott if she attempted to get near him
again.”</p>

<p>“Again?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, Lieutenant. She went out of the room
last night right after he had knocked and said
good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Out into the hallway?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When did she come back?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t come back.”</p>

<p>“Then when was the next time you saw her?”</p>

<p>“When you rang for me—after you had found Mr.
Endicott in the cupboard.”</p>

<p>“And you think it was Mrs. Endicott who put him
there.” Lieutenant Valcour thought for a moment
of the broken finger nail of Mrs. Endicott’s otherwise
immaculate hand. “But why, Miss Roberts, should
she kill her—tiger?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mr. Hollander could tell you that better
than I.”</p>

<p>“And why did you get a gun to prevent Mrs. Endicott
from going again to her husband, when you knew
she was under the influence of a narcotic, that she was
unconscious, and couldn’t possibly move?”</p>

<p>“Because, Lieutenant, she never drank the
narcotic.”</p>

<h2>Chapter XXI. <br> 3:51 a. m.—A Woman’s Slipper</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour felt a distinct shock, and his
eyes became predatorily alert. If this astonishing
thing was true and Mrs. Endicott had not taken
the narcotic prepared for her by Dr. Worth, then the
bypaths one might dart along were numerous and
alarming indeed.</p>

<p>“How do you know, Miss Roberts?” he said.</p>

<p>“Because when the nurse went downstairs to make
that coffee I went over to the bed. I wanted to take
a close look at Mrs. Endicott. Have you ever felt
that desire to look closely at something that you hate
very much? It’s the curiosity of hate, I suppose. I
put my hand on the spread, at the edge, so that I
could lean down. The spread was damp; something
had been poured on it. There wasn’t anything that
could have been poured on it except the narcotic.
She’d recovered consciousness, you see, when the
nurse and Dr. Worth brought her in from here and
put her to bed.”</p>

<p>“But wouldn’t he or the nurse have seen her pour
it out?”</p>

<p>“None of us saw it, Lieutenant, because she said,
just after the doctor had handed her the glass,
‘There’s blood on that dresser.’ We all looked at the
dresser, of course. Naturally there wasn’t any blood
on it. The doctor thought she was delirious. She was
just finishing drinking when we turned around.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you accuse her—when you felt the damp
spot on the spread?”</p>

<p>“What was the use? She never would have admitted
it. I believe,” Roberts said fiercely, “that I
could have stuck pins in her and that she’d have
endured the pain rather than admit it. And suddenly
I began to feel afraid—not so much of her, as of what
she might do to Mr. Endicott. She was playing a trick
and I didn’t know just what the purpose of it was. I
ran upstairs and got my gun, then came right back.”</p>

<p>“She was still in bed?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But the shooting was over, and the room
was cold. The room was cold”—Roberts’s voice was
very intense as she drove her points home—“and
her skin was cold, and her breathing was heavy from
recent exertion. I think I was going to kill her. I
<em>would</em> have killed her if the nurse hadn’t come in
just then.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell someone of this at once, Miss
Roberts?”</p>

<p>“Would you have? Would anyone have?”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite understand.”</p>

<p>“There had just been that shooting—and I had a
gun. I wanted to get rid of it. By the time I had got
rid of it, it was too late. I couldn’t say anything then
without practically accusing myself of a murder
I didn’t commit.”</p>

<p>“You’ll stay here in the house, Miss Roberts?”</p>

<p>“Naturally, since I’m to be accused of having
killed Mr. Endicott.”</p>

<p>“Not as yet, Miss Roberts.”</p>

<p>“It won’t bother me.” She added bitterly, as she
started for the door, “You’ll find me a tractable
prisoner.”</p>

<p>“One minute please, Miss Roberts. How long were
you gone from Mrs. Endicott’s room when you went
upstairs to get the gun?”</p>

<p>“Just long enough to run up and back again. I
have no idea, really.”</p>

<p>“Where is your room?”</p>

<p>“On the upper floor—the room to the left of the
corridor in the front of the house.”</p>

<p>“And whereabouts did you keep the gun?”</p>

<p>“In my trunk—where it is now.”</p>

<p>“Was the trunk locked?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I keep it locked.”</p>

<p>“And the keys for it?”</p>

<p>“In a purse. The purse was in a dresser drawer.”</p>

<p>“Then that gives us a pretty good idea of the
length of time you must have been gone, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it does. Three or four minutes,
probably.”</p>

<p>“Nearer, I imagine, to five or six. But we don’t
require the actual number of minutes. The point
we need is, rather, a comparison of two different
operations within the same time limit. While you
were going through the various movements you have
described, would Mrs. Endicott have had the time
to get out of bed, supply herself with a revolver, open
a window, and, from the balcony, shoot Mr. Endicott,
return to her room, and be in bed again by the time
you came down? I think so, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“There would have been plenty of time for that.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been with Mrs. Endicott for quite a while.
Have you ever noticed whether or not she owns a
pistol?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I have. No, I’m sure I’ve never seen
one. That doesn’t prove anything, though. There
are any number of private places where she may have
kept it. It is also possible”—Roberts seemed desperately
earnest in her effort to strengthen each link in
her accusation, for she was accusing rather than
simply offering a theory—“that someone may recently
have given her a revolver, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Everything is possible.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hollander, for example?”</p>

<p>“A very good example.”</p>

<p>He said nothing further, and after a while the
stillness became almost physically oppressive.
Roberts was finished with emotions. “Is that all?” she
said, and her voice was colourless.</p>

<p>“I believe so, Miss Roberts—except that I wish
you would tell me why, in view of your recent
insinuations concerning Mrs. Endicott and Hollander,
you ever suggested him as the proper friend
to stay with her husband to-night. It’s a little
inconsistent, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Very.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you do it?”</p>

<p>“I have nothing further to say.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour went abruptly to the door and
opened it. Cassidy and Hansen were standing near by
in the corridor.</p>

<p>“Hansen,” he said, “go with Miss Roberts up to
her room. There is a gun in her trunk. She will give
it to you. Keep it for me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Roberts went outside.</p>

<p>“Am I to consider myself under arrest,
Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Roberts. But, as I have explained, you
are not to leave the house. Cassidy, come inside here
with me.”</p>

<p>Cassidy came in and closed the door. He watched
Lieutenant Valcour draw the sheet up again over
Endicott’s face.</p>

<p>“What’s Dr. Worth doing, Cassidy?”</p>

<p>“He has gone back to bed, sir. Shall I go get
him?” Cassidy cast one suspicious look toward the
bed.</p>

<p>“No, let him sleep. There’s nothing just this
instant. I’ll want to see him in about a quarter of an
hour, though.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour went into the bathroom,
opened the window, and went outside onto the balcony.
The gray before dawning was in the sky, and a
rare clearness was vibrant in the fresh, sweet air.</p>

<p>The outline of the garden down below was quite
distinct. There were other gardens belonging to the
adjacent houses, too, and to the houses backing them
from the rear. It was a street of gardens which
bloomed, Lieutenant Valcour reflected, for the
express benefit of caretakers in summer, while their
owners spent the season at fashionable resorts either
in the mountains or on the shore.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour went and carefully examined
with his flashlight the window to Endicott’s room
that had been raised from the bottom when the shot
was fired. He played the light upon the surface of its
glass. It was quite clean. There was no trace of any
pressing of noses or of foreheads against its polished
surface. Nor, on the stone sill, were there any telltale
threads of silk, or any of the various clues that would
serve to indicate a woman’s presence.</p>

<p>He stared speculatively for a minute at the windows
of the room above, where the curiously vindictive
Mrs. Siddons was now presumably resting, or
else indulging in her blank-eyed game of mental
maledictions. No, he couldn’t really visualize her as
descending to the balcony by a rope or any other
kind of ladder. A hundred years ago, perhaps, she
might have gone so far as to shape a replica of Mr.
Endicott in wax and then, with appropriate
incantations, proceed to stick pins in such portions of
it as would cabalistically do the most good. But there
was no such simple expedient left her in our modern
skeptic age. It would be necessary, of course, to
interview her further concerning those vague, bitter hints
she had thrown out about outrageous actions on the
part of Endicott toward the maids.</p>

<p>Even the city could not kill the fair fresh breezes
of dawn. He stared at the dimming stars and
wondered whether Roberts’s extraordinary statement
was a lie. For after all it hinged upon nothing more
significant than a damp spot at the edge of a spread,
and Roberts could easily have spilled something there
herself to offer as corroborative evidence to her tale.
Was she, he wondered, quite so smart? And from all
that he had been able to judge of her, he rather
thought that she was.</p>

<p>He would have to consult with Dr. Worth, of
course, before doing anything drastic. And the doctor
would probably raise a holler, especially since he
had just gone to bed and would have to be yanked
summarily out of it again. Well, bed-yankings were
to be expected in the lives of doctors and of the
police; they were expected to be perpetually on tap,
like heat or water.</p>

<p>He made his way slowly toward the windows of
Mrs. Endicott’s room, carefully inspecting the balcony
and sills with his flashlight as he went along.
There were no smudges, no threads, no clues until
he reached the last window in the row. And there,
on the balcony floor just below its sash, something
blazed in the circle of his torch a bright jade green.</p>

<p>It was a woman’s slipper.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch22">

<h2>Chapter XXII. <br> 4:14 a. m.—Tap—Tap—Tap</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour picked the slipper up and
sighed. It was a distressingly leading and decisive
clue, but it did not lead in a direction he cared to
follow, nor did it decide things as he thought they
ought to be decided.</p>

<p>On the surface of it, the case seemed blatantly
plain: Hollander had come to the house at seven to
save Mrs. Endicott from committing murder or
suicide and had shocked Endicott almost to death—and
just a short while ago Mrs. Endicott had shot her
husband to prevent him from making a statement
that would convict Hollander.</p>

<p>Rubbish!</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour flatly refused to believe it.
And yet one had to believe that Hollander had
certainly intended to stab Endicott with that knife;
the point was irrefutable. Furthermore, Hollander’s
motives remained clear enough and beautifully
simple: he wanted to protect Mrs. Endicott.</p>

<p>But what about her motives?</p>

<p>And Roberts’s?</p>

<p>And as a kernel to the whole perplexing enigma,
what had been the object of the search through
Endicott’s pockets and among the papers in the
left-hand upper drawer of his desk?</p>

<p>There was nothing to be gained, however, by standing
outside on the balcony and admiring the flushing
sky and breathing in with the manner of a connoisseur
the morning air. Lieutenant Valcour returned,
via the bathroom window, to Endicott’s room.</p>

<p>“The night’s almost over, Lieutenant,” said
Cassidy by way of greeting.</p>

<p>“Almost over, Cassidy.”</p>

<p>“And it’s been a hell of a night, too, if you don’t
mind my saying it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind your saying it.”</p>

<p>“Especially for him.”</p>

<p>Cassidy jerked a muscular thumb toward the bed.</p>

<p>“Least of all for him, Cassidy.”</p>

<p>“He may be well out of it at that.”</p>

<p>“He is. There’s a lot of beautiful tripe written
about how all people kill the things they love.
Metaphysically, perhaps. But with a bullet, Cassidy?
Not so.”</p>

<p>“I don’t get you, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t strange, Cassidy. So far I don’t even
get myself.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour went to the door and opened
it. Hansen was standing outside, and in his hand was
a gun wrapped in a clean handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Roberts’s gun, Hansen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lieutenant. It was just where you said it
would be, in the trunk. I wrapped it in a handkerchief
to keep any prints you might want on it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Hansen. Go upstairs now and wake
up Dr. Worth. Ask him if he will please come down
here at once.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lieutenant.” Hansen hesitated for a minute.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, Hansen?”</p>

<p>“I understood you all right didn’t I, sir,” Hansen
said uncomfortably, “when you told me that maid
wasn’t to be put under arrest?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t want to do anything about her as yet.
Later on we may book her on a violation of the
Sullivan Law and again we may not.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour took the gun and went back
into the room with it, closing the door. He carefully
unfolded enough of the handkerchief so that the
barrel was exposed. He sniffed this and decided that
the gun had neither been recently fired nor cleaned.
There was just the definite odourlessness which one
finds with guns that have not been used or taken
care of for a very long time. So far, then, he was
inclined to believe that Roberts’s story was correct.</p>

<p>“Is that the rod that done the trick, Lieutenant?”
said Cassidy, who had been keenly interested in the
sniffings.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t, Cassidy. This gun hasn’t been fired
for years, maybe.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish it was. I’d like to get out of this
joint.”</p>

<p>“Still nervous, Cassidy?”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t nervous, Lieutenant. I’m just
uncomfortable. It’s like there was something in this
case that hasn’t broken yet. You know what I mean?
Something we ain’t so much as put a finger on.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour knew very well just exactly
what Cassidy meant. He, too, felt that same
indefinable effect of impending “somethings” that were
connected with obscure danger. It was an emotion,
however, which required official scowlings. After all,
psychic patrolmen were not considered as being to
the best interests of the force. One shouldn’t be
allowed, really, to graduate into psychic realms
anywhere below the rank of lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Discounting your weekly adventures between
paper covers, this is your first real murder case, isn’t
it, Cassidy?”</p>

<p>“I thank God it is, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll get used to them after a while. Before
you’re called in on your fourth or fifth you’ll be
finished with having presentiments.”</p>

<p>“Will they be likely to be like this one, sir?”</p>

<p>“That will depend entirely, Cassidy, upon just
how much publicity this one is given in the papers,
as well as on the supply at hand of potential victims
who have weak hearts. I dare say the method will
become fashionable for a while.” There was a peevish
rap on the door. “Ah, come in, Doctor.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth was just as peevish as his knock. The
camel’s-hair dressing gown in which he was still
bundled hinted blurringly at indignant muscles that
quivered beneath its loose folds. His hair was
rumpled-looking and frowsy.</p>

<p>“Really, Lieutenant,” he began, “this is getting
to be beyond a joke.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Doctor, but I had to discuss Mrs.
Endicott’s condition with you most seriously and at
once.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth paled a little at this.</p>

<p>“Nothing’s happened to her, too, has there?”</p>

<p>“No, Doctor, nothing has. And I don’t think
that just now I could stand another murder. It’s
about her physical condition in general. Is her heart
all right?”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth’s curiosity was beginning to get the
upper hand over his grouch.</p>

<p>“Perfectly sound. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because I want to try an experiment on her.”</p>

<p>“You want to what, sir?” Dr. Worth almost
shouted it. He was thoroughly awake now.</p>

<p>“Not so loud, please, Doctor. I want you to let me
stay in the room alone with your patient. You can
open the connecting bathroom door a little and watch
me through its crack, but I want the nurse out of the
way. And I don’t want you to make any noise or
comments while you’re watching. I don’t want Mrs.
Endicott to know that you’re there.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth looked at Lieutenant Valcour sharply.
“This is nonsense. She couldn’t possibly tell who was
or who wasn’t there. She’s unconscious.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she isn’t, Doctor. This is what her maid
has just told me.” Lieutenant Valcour offered Dr.
Worth Roberts’s astonishing theory concerning the
poured-out narcotic, and Dr. Worth was quite
properly astonished. “So you see it’s a possibility,
Doctor, and the fact of my finding that slipper outside
of the window makes it practically a certainty.”</p>

<p>“It’s the most astounding thing I’ve ever heard of
in my life. If you don’t intend to shock her,
Lieutenant, I’ll agree to anything you say.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t do anything rough, Doctor, like discharging
a gun off near her ear, or pinching her, or slapping
her, or any of the tricks which are so popularly
supposed to be kept up the sleeve of a policeman. You
can stop me at any minute if you object to anything
I may be doing.”</p>

<p>“Have you planned just what you will do?”</p>

<p>“With a woman like Mrs. Endicott there wouldn’t
be any use in planning anything. All that I can do
in advance is to create an atmosphere and then do
whatever occurs to me as being best when the proper
time comes. There won’t be anything complicated
about it.”</p>

<p>“Just what sort of an atmosphere, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Well, in the first place I’ll call the nurse outside
into the corridor and you can tell her not to go back
in again until I say so. You might suggest to her
that she go down to the kitchen and make some
coffee—she seems a little dippy about coffee—or
something. Then we’ll leave Mrs. Endicott quite
alone in her room for a minute or two. If she’s really
faking, she’ll begin to worry about what is going on.
Then the door will open again and, instead of the
nurse, I’ll come in. She’ll be pretty certain to suspect
that I’ve found the slipper, but will be all the more
careful to keep up her pretence of being under the
influence of the narcotic. If she gets away with that,
you know, she can always claim that Roberts herself
must have dropped the slipper onto the balcony as a
plant. The main thing is that Mrs. Endicott won’t
know just what’s up, and when a woman of her
temperament can’t figure a thing out mentally, it
about drives her crazy.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose, Lieutenant, that when you get
her into this receptive state you’ll speak to her?”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour laughed. “On the contrary,
Doctor, I haven’t the slightest intention of saying a
single word. Shall we go now? After you’ve arranged
things with Nurse Vickers you can come back in here
again and start watching from the bathroom.”</p>

<p>They went outside, and Lieutenant Valcour rapped
softly on Mrs. Endicott’s door. It opened a bit, and
Nurse Vickers looked out. She saw Dr. Worth and
came outside, shutting the door behind her.</p>

<p>“You wanted to see me, Doctor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Vickers. How is Mrs. Endicott?”</p>

<p>“Quite comfortable, Doctor. She’s breathing as
peacefully as a child.”</p>

<p>“There haven’t been any signs of restlessness?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Doctor. She hasn’t budged since I’ve
been watching her.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth mildly raised his eyebrows. “That in
itself is rather curious,” he said.</p>

<p>“Curious, Doctor?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing to be alarmed at, Miss Vickers.
You look a little tired. Run downstairs and drink
some coffee. The lieutenant, here, will stay with Mrs.
Endicott, and you’re not to go back into her room
again until he says so.”</p>

<p>“Help!” thought Lieutenant Valcour. As a
detective Dr. Worth was a darned fine doctor. Miss
Vickers, as he had expected, was instantly curious.</p>

<p>“Something more wrong, Doctor?”</p>

<p>“No Miss Vickers,” Lieutenant Valcour said
coldly. “Please do as the doctor instructed, and at
once.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>Nurse Vickers, feeling a little outraged, vanished
toward the stairs.</p>

<p>“Shall I go and stand by the bathroom door now?”
said Dr. Worth.</p>

<p>“If you wish. Don’t make the slightest sound when
you’re opening it, and don’t open it more than an
inch at the most, please.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth, feeling very much like one of those
fabulous characters he had read about in Fenimore
Cooper when a child, went back into Endicott’s room.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour waited another full minute before
he opened the door and went inside. He did not
look at Mrs. Endicott, but walked softly over to a
chair, lifted it, and placed it close beside the bed.
He drew the slipper from his pocket and sat down.</p>

<p>There was an utter and complete hush. For three
minutes—he timed himself with his wrist watch—he
sat motionless and stared at the closed lids of Mrs.
Endicott’s eyes.</p>

<p>Then he began to tap the slipper quite softly, but
quite persistently and with a rhythmic regularity,
upon an arm of the chair.</p>

<p>Tap—tap—tap—tap—tap——</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott’s face retained the smooth
expressionlessness of slumber.</p>

<p>Tap—tap—tap——</p>

<p>Her breathing held the steady depths of sleep.</p>

<p>Tap—tap—tap—tap——</p>

<p>“If you do that much longer,” she said quietly, “I
shall go insane.”</p>

<h2>Chapter XXIII. <br> 4:29 a. m.—A Turn of the Screw</h2>

<p>“You needn’t say anything you don’t care to, Mrs.
Endicott.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you didn’t use the stereotyped formula,
Lieutenant. It would have disappointed me if you
had. Get me a cigarette, please; there are some over
there on the dresser.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour stood up. He got the cigarettes
and lighted one for Mrs. Endicott and one for
himself.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have dropped your slipper outside
of the window,” he said.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have found it.”</p>

<p>Her eyes, now that they were opened, were admirably
guarded, and her fingers, as they held the
cigarette, showed no trace of nervousness.</p>

<p>“The slipper is of no great consequence, Mrs.
Endicott. There are so many other things, too, you
see.”</p>

<p>“Sort of a wholesale strewing of clues? I never
imagined you as bothering very much with clues. It’s
people you’re more interested in: reading their
minds.”</p>

<p>Her eyes offered an almost impudent invitation
that he read hers.</p>

<p>“Whom were you aiming at when you fired, Mrs.
Endicott, at your husband or at Mr. Hollander?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott blew smoke rings elaborately.</p>

<p>“At neither, Lieutenant. I didn’t have a gun.”</p>

<p>“Then it was just curiosity?”</p>

<p>“What was?”</p>

<p>“Your going out on the balcony.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t go out on the balcony. I’ve never been
on it in my life.”</p>

<p>“I am not stupid, Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>“Nor very credulous, either.”</p>

<p>“No, nor credulous.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble with truth: it often sounds so
silly.”</p>

<p>“Surely you realize how things look against you,
Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>“Black.”</p>

<p>“The worst of all is your not having taken the
narcotic, and then having pretended to be in a state of
unconsciousness.”</p>

<p>Her eyes became stupefyingly innocent. “Is it
illegal to decide not to take medicine, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>His respect for her as an adversary began to mount
by leaps and bounds. “No, Mrs. Endicott. But in the
present case it was purposefully deceptive.”</p>

<p>“Why, I simply disliked hurting Dr. Worth’s
feelings; that was all.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour pictured her maintaining that
attitude—smartly dressed in becomingly plain black,
very innocent, very beautiful-looking—before the
twelve impressionable and normally dumb people
one finds on juries. He was grudgingly afraid she
could get away with it.</p>

<p>“And it isn’t illegal, either,” she went on, “to go
to sleep, is it?”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour decided that if anything was
to be gained from the interview he would have to
give a turn to the screw.</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Endicott, sleeping isn’t illegal. Even,”
he added negligently, “if your husband has just been
killed, and your—well, whatever state of relationship
exists between you and Mr. Hollander—your friend,
let us say, is wounded to the point of death.”</p>

<p>The cigarette dropped from her fingers to the floor.
Lieutenant Valcour crushed it with the sole of his
shoe.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you.”</p>

<p>Her voice had the same pallid qualities as her skin.</p>

<p>“You must have seen for yourself, Mrs. Endicott,
that he was pretty badly hurt when he slipped to the
floor. There was blood enough smeared around,
goodness knows.”</p>

<p>“You’re trying to trap me.”</p>

<p>“Just stating facts, Mrs. Endicott. Of course you
may have left the instant after you fired and so
not have seen Mr. Hollander shot down by the
police.”</p>

<p>“You are being vulgarly brutal.”</p>

<p>“You were certainly in a frantic enough hurry
to have dropped your slipper and not to have bothered
to pick it up. Did you throw the gun into the
garden, Mrs. Endicott? We’re bound to find it, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Hollander still in the house?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Where have they taken him?”</p>

<p>“To the hospital.”</p>

<p>“Please ring for my maid and leave the room. I
must go to him immediately.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“Will you please leave this room?”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to realize, Mrs. Endicott, that
you are under arrest.”</p>

<p>The thought stunned her. Her head fell back
among the pillows as if it had been thrown there.</p>

<p>“But that’s silly—silly, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“You admitted yourself, Mrs. Endicott, that the
truth is always silly.”</p>

<p>“You are actually charging me with the murder
of my husband?”</p>

<p>“ ‘Arrest’ was perhaps an injudicious word. I
am holding you, Mrs. Endicott, as a material
witness, for the present.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott had recovered somewhat from the
shock.</p>

<p>“I shan’t be bromidic, Lieutenant, and attempt
either tears or bribery. I’m not stupid enough to
think that either would affect you in the slightest
from the performance of duty. But I should like to
appeal to your reason.”</p>

<p>“You will find me a sympathetic listener, Mrs.
Endicott. My wretched conceit forces me to add that
I shall also be an intelligent one.”</p>

<p>“You see, I knew pretty well what was going
on from hearing the nurse and Roberts talking about
it. Lieutenant, just what do you want me to admit?”</p>

<p>“That you were on the balcony.”</p>

<p>“But I wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Then how did your slipper get there?”</p>

<p>“It fell from my foot.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour stood up abruptly. “You will
have to pardon me, Mrs. Endicott,” he said, “while
I search this room.”</p>

<p>“You misunderstand me. I mean exactly what I
say. I wasn’t on the balcony, and the slipper did
fall off my foot. If you must know it, I was straddling
the window sill.”</p>

<p>“What stopped you from going out, Mrs.
Endicott?”</p>

<p>“The sound of the shooting. It unnerved me. I
almost fell back into the room and closed the window.
I knew that I had dropped a slipper outside, but the
idea of doing anything further than hurrying back
into bed terrified me.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour examined the slipper he still
held in his hand. “This is a slipper for the left foot,”
he said. “And in that case, when you were straddling
the window it is the foot which must have been on
the outside. Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“That’s rather elementary, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Quite. But it serves to prove that at the moment
when the shots were fired you could look along the
balcony toward the windows of your husband’s room.
Did you?”</p>

<p>“I imagine so. I’m not quite certain, really. It was
absolutely dark out there.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, there was a glow cast on the
balcony from the farthest window, which was open
a little, wasn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Yes, I think there was.”</p>

<p>“And did you see anybody standing at that window
when the shots were fired?”</p>

<p>“You mean on the balcony?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That is all, Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>“You don’t believe me.”</p>

<p>“Frankly, I don’t.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott’s expression hardened perceptibly.
Whether from bitterness or from some sudden
private determination it was difficult to say.</p>

<p>“Does being detained as a material witness prohibit
me from getting out of bed and dressing?” she
said.</p>

<p>“Not at all. In fact, it is essential that you do so.
You see, we detain our material witnesses in jail.”</p>

<p>He heard again, as he had heard it earlier in the
night, the muted echo of brass bells in her voice. “If
you will leave me then, please?”</p>

<p>“Just as soon as I have searched the room.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“For a revolver, Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott closed her eyes. She turned on her
side and faced the wall. Lieutenant Valcour
conducted his search with the thoroughness and speed
born of experience. In the room, in the room’s
cupboard, in the various drawers, beneath the different
pieces of furniture, there was no gun. He took a
dressing gown and placed it on the bed.</p>

<p>“Put this on, please, Mrs. Endicott, I want to
search the bed.”</p>

<p>She did so, without either comment or objection.
She went to the window and stared unseeingly at the
breaking day.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour removed the spread, and with
a pencil roughly outlined the damp spot where the
narcotic had been spilled. Then he folded the spread
and tucked it under one arm. The rest of the
bedclothes, the mattress, the pillows, concealed no gun.
He walked to the door.</p>

<p>“I will send your maid to you, Mrs. Endicott,
if you wish.”</p>

<p>She continued to stare through the window and
to present her back to him. She said nothing. He
tried to catch the suggestion in her pose. It wasn’t a
gesture of petty rudeness or angry spite; nor was it
by any means suggestive of despair or fear. He went
outside and closed the door.</p>

<p>And as he crossed the corridor to Endicott’s room
it occurred to him with shocking clearness that, in
spite of the idea’s seeming absurdity, her pose had
suggested a very definite mood of positive
exaltation.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXIV. <br> 4:41 a. m.—As the Colours of Dawn</h2>

<p>“Well,” Lieutenant Valcour said, as he joined Dr.
Worth in Endicott’s room, “what do you think
now?”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth was finished with bewilderments. In
spite of the camel’s-hair robe swathing him, he had
recaptured to an impressive extent his air of dignity.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant,” he said, “I think that my services
are no longer required in this house. With your
permission, I shall dismiss the two nurses and go home.”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly, Doctor, if you wish. The prosecuting
attorney will probably require your testimony
to secure an indictment and will want you later on at
the trial, but I’m sure he will bother you just as little
as possible. We realize how annoying any court work
is to a doctor.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to testify whenever required.”</p>

<p>“Will you also let me know where to keep in
touch with the two nurses? Their testimony will be
needed, too.”</p>

<p>Dr. Worth stated the name and address of the
Nurses’ Home at which Miss Vickers and Miss Murrow
could always be reached, and Lieutenant Valcour
wrote them down in his notebook.</p>

<p>“Would it bother you very much, Lieutenant, to
let Mrs. Endicott know that I have gone, when you
see her?”</p>

<p>“Not at all, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“I doubt whether she will require my services
again.” He paused for a moment at the doorway.
“That woman, sir, is of iron.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder, Doctor. At any rate, she is
pretty thoroughly encased in metal. I’ll send Cassidy
along with you to pass you and the nurses by O’Brian
down at the door. No one can leave the house, you
see, without permission.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Lieutenant. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Doctor, and thanks for all your
assistance. Cassidy, come back after you’ve seen the
doctor out, and stay in the corridor. I’ll call when I
need you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The door closed, and Lieutenant Valcour was alone.
With a persistence that was becoming annoying, the
same curious feeling of lurking danger crept out at
him from the room’s stillnesses. His nerves were
usually as steady as the quality reputed to be enjoyed
by a rock, and the strange little jumpings they were
going in for were getting that fabulous animal known
as his goat.</p>

<p>He went over to the chair before the flat-topped
desk and sat down. There was that drawer filled with
disordered papers to be gone through. He removed
the drawer and emptied it of its contents by the
simple expedient of turning it upside down onto the
top of the desk.</p>

<p>There were, mixed up among bills and receipts, a
surprising number of letters from women. He read
each one of them carefully and felt a little sorrier,
at the conclusion of each, for the future of the race—not
so much because of any danger to its morals as to
its mentality.</p>

<p>He made a little group of each batch of notes from
the same woman. One pile topped the list with the
number of ten. These were signed “Bebe” and were
addressed with deplorable monotony to “My cave
man.” Endicott must have been rather an ass, he
decided, as well as a pretty low sort of an animal. It
was all very well for Roberts to rave on about
soldiers, and simple hearts, and war, and things. That’s
just what it amounted to: raving. What if Endicott
and, presumably, her brother had had simple hearts.
So had guinea pigs.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour wondered whether everyone
else connected with the case was quite sane and he
just a little mad. Roberts—Mrs. Endicott—the
housekeeper—Hollander—Madame Velasquez. They
all seemed a little touched, and that was a sign of
madness when one considered everyone else but one’s
self insane. But no one was ever truly normal under
disagreeable and terrifying circumstances; at least,
he had never found anyone who was so.</p>

<p>The letters were meaningless as possible clues
to a motive; just a sticky conglomeration of lust,
greed, dullness, and execrable taste. He shoved them
aside.</p>

<p>He watched the strengthening light of day as it
came through the window across the desk before
him. Such sky as he saw was of rubbed emerald,
and the backs of the houses across the intervening
gardens were mauve and dark gray, with lines of
lemon yellow running thinly along their roofs.</p>

<p>He thought of <i>Bohême</i>—dawn always made him
think of <i>Bohême</i>—and hummed a bar or two of it
softly. Then he thought of Mrs. Endicott, and his
thoughts were pastelled in the colours of the dawn:
a woman of half-tones and overlapping lacquer
shades.</p>

<p>It became quite clear in his mind that she never
would have killed her husband. Or Hollander. That,
in fact, she never would have killed anybody at all.
The belief became fixed, even in face of the sizeable
amount of evidence against her.</p>

<p>He reviewed her case, in digest, as the prosecuting
attorney might present it to a jury: from the very
start there was that contrary fact of her having
telephoned for the police. Why? On the slender
ground of a pencilled note that might or might not
have been a threat, and an instinctive premonition
that her husband was in danger. The prosecution
would thereupon interpolate a smart crack or two on
the general subject of premonitions, fortune tellings,
and the Ace of Spades. They would point out that
people who committed crimes which were bound to
be shortly discovered occasionally got in touch with
the police in order to use the gesture as a premise of
their innocence.</p>

<p>There were her definite admissions of intent to
kill her husband—her having left her bedroom
immediately upon his having knocked and said
good-bye—and her recent most damaging actions in regard
to the narcotic and having been on the balcony.</p>

<p>Motive?</p>

<p>The prosecuting attorney could offer a thousand.
The most prominent ones would include a jealous
rage at her husband’s easily proved peccadillos with
other women and her own rather significant attitude
toward Hollander. Yes, it would be only too possible
for the prosecuting attorney to get a conviction
against Mrs. Endicott, and to rope Hollander in as an
accomplice. He’d want the weapon, though, to make
the case complete. Lieutenant Valcour had forgotten
about the weapon. He stood up, went to the door, and
opened it. Hansen was standing outside, having taken
his post there until Cassidy should come back from
letting out Dr. Worth and the nurses.</p>

<p>“Hansen,” Lieutenant Valcour said, “I want you
to search the backyard for a revolver that may have
been thrown there from the balcony. If you can’t
find it, search the two adjoining backyards, and the
three in the rear as well. Don’t wake up the people
in the other houses, just get a stepladder and cross
the party walls.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Report to me as soon as you’ve finished, or find
anything.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour closed the door again. The revolver
would clinch the case: Mrs. Endicott the principal,
and Hollander the accomplice. What a sweet
bunch of muck it would be, too. There were all sorts
of sob angles: Hollander and Endicott as Damon and
Pythias, brothers in arms during the war who were
transformed through the vicious caprice of a siren into
Cain and Abel. Or would Mrs. Endicott spatter the
tabloids as a woman wronged who had by a reversal
of the usual position of the sexes taken her just
revenge beneath the legendary cloak of the unwritten
law? If her lawyers were smart, she would. And they
would be smart, too. She’d probably have the most
impressive battery of legal guns that were procurable
in the state lined up on her side.</p>

<p>It wasn’t the gun only that Lieutenant Valcour
wanted. There was something else. Endicott’s hat:
that was it. How did the person who had been caught
in the cupboard fit in with Endicott’s hat? The
answer came to him with the sudden clearness that will
enlighten a problem that the subconscious mind has
been working on for some time. The hat was the final
touch to the person’s disguise. And the fact would
pre-suppose a woman. A man’s hat would add
immeasurably to any disguise adopted by a woman.</p>

<p>But which woman?</p>

<p>And why had his hat been in the cupboard?</p>

<p>And still there was no answer to the baffling
question as to what had been the object of the search
through Endicott’s pockets and his papers. There
was, of course, a perfectly plain and logically possible
solution: the object or paper, whatever it was, had
been found and had been carried off by the thief
along with Endicott’s hat and the top button from
his overcoat. And if such were the case, just what that
object or paper was might never be known.</p>

<p>For the fourth time since he had been sitting at
the desk Lieutenant Valcour sniffed the air. There
was a faint trace of scent—a curiously reminiscent
odour—all but intangible, but which he was quite
certain he had encountered in some different locality
at some time during the night. It was only apparent
when he sat at the desk, and the deduction was
reached without too much mental labour that it must,
hence, emanate from something connected with the
desk. Perhaps that aperture from which he had pulled
the drawer——</p>

<p>The telephone rang sharply. He drew the instrument
to him across the top of the desk, and took
the receiver from the hook.</p>

<p>The call came, he was informed, from Central
Office.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch25">

<h2>Chapter XXV. <br> 5:01 a. m.—Lunatic Vistas</h2>

<p>The report from Central Office which Lieutenant
Valcour received over the telephone contained one
definitely useful piece of information: the person who
had used the comb and brushes belonging to Endicott
had been a blonde and was either a man or a woman
with bobbed hair.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Endicott, Lieutenant Valcour reflected
as he hung up the receiver, had blonde shingled hair.
And so, except for the shingling, did Hollander.</p>

<p>Roberts, on the other hand, had not.</p>

<p>And where, he wanted to know, was his inspiring
confidence in the innocence of Mrs. Endicott now?
Precisely where it had been before. His mind began
to gibber. What <em>was</em> that curious scent, that trace
of an aroma? What about Hollander’s roommate:
the young Southerner who preyed upon wealthy
women in night clubs? Had Endicott evidence that
Hollander was mixed up in similar jobs, and had
Hollander come to steal it, or silence Endicott? Rats!
And what were Marge Myles’s address and telephone
number doing in Mrs. Endicott’s personal directory?
And why had Mrs. Endicott been such a stupid liar
as to say she had seen no one on the balcony at the
time when the shots were fired, when the only
apparent place from which the shot that had killed
Endicott could have been fired was the balcony? . . .
A knock-knock.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he said.</p>

<p>Cassidy opened the door.</p>

<p>“There’s an old dame downstairs, Lieutenant,
who insisted on coming in. She wants to see you.”</p>

<p>“Did she say who she was, Cassidy?”</p>

<p>“She did. And you can believe it or not, sir, but her
name is Molasses.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour made a desperate clutch at
his scattering reason.</p>

<p>“By all means, Cassidy,” he said, “show Mrs.
Molasses right up.”</p>

<p>Madame Velasquez, in the penetrating light of
early morning, was beyond words. The intervening
hours since Lieutenant Valcour had left her, wigless
and talking to herself in her stepdaughter’s
apartment, had unquestionably been ones of worry. As
she came into the room Lieutenant Valcour motioned
to Cassidy to wait outside and close the corridor door.</p>

<p>Over her black sequinned dress she had thrown
an evening cape of blue satin edged with marabou,
and on her wig rested a picture hat trimmed with
plumes. Her eyes ignored the details of Endicott’s
room, of Endicott’s body stretched beneath the sheet;
ignored everything but Lieutenant Valcour, the
man whom she had come to see.</p>

<p>“Marge is dead,” she said.</p>

<p>Her voice still retained the curious qualities that
made it suggest a scream.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour wearily closed his eyes. One
other murder would truly prove to be the straw with
himself in the rôle of the already overladen camel.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Madame Velasquez,” he said, “and
tell me how it happened.”</p>

<p>Madame Velasquez spread billows of blue satin
and marabou into an armchair.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how it happened,” she said.</p>

<p>“Did you find her body in the apartment?”</p>

<p>“There ain’t no body.” Madame Velasquez then
added, as her brittle little eyes glittered with a strange
sort of conviction, “He made away with it.”</p>

<p>“Who did, Madame Velasquez?”</p>

<p>“Herbert Endicott,” she said.</p>

<p>For a startled moment Lieutenant Valcour stared
sharply down curious vistas: <em>had</em> Endicott killed
Marge Myles, perhaps having called for her just after
she had written that note to her mother? He brought
himself up shortly. Utter nonsense! Endicott was in
this very room at the time when Marge Myles must
have been writing that note and was himself in the
process of being killed.</p>

<p>“That isn’t possible, Madame Velasquez,” he
said quietly. “Endicott was himself attacked right
here at about the time your stepdaughter must have
been writing that note to you. That was at seven last
evening—at the very moment he was to call for her
at her apartment—and it must have been a little
after seven when she wrote, as she states in the note
that he hadn’t come.”</p>

<p>“No matter”—her beringed fingers fluttered
extravagantly—“I feel certain he did it, and I want
him punished and caught.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Endicott is dead, Madame Velasquez.”</p>

<p>“That’s what <em>you</em> say,” she said.</p>

<p>Was he really, Lieutenant Valcour wondered, going
mad? There seemed such terribly disturbing possibilities
of fact in every absurd aspect on the case the
woman facing him opened up. Who, after all, <em>had</em>
identified Endicott? His wife, and that only by
implication; his friend Hollander, again by implication;
Roberts had seen the dead man’s face, but she, in
common with all the world, was mad; Dr. Worth—what
proof was there that Dr. Worth <em>was</em> Dr. Worth,
or that the telephone number given him by Mrs.
Endicott had been Dr. Worth’s? It could all have
been arranged by some clever mob. . . .</p>

<p>“This is folly,” he said abruptly, really more to
convince himself than the nutlike face peering at him
from the armchair. What he needed was sleep—just
a couple of hours of good sleep. “Madame Velasquez,
that body on the bed is Herbert Endicott. Now tell
me as lucidly as you can, please, just why you say
that Marge is dead.”</p>

<p>Her little eyes began to glitter with rage. “I believe
she has killed herself to spite me.” The knotted paste
jewels on her thin fingers quivered indignantly. “She
did it to make me suffer,” she added, “to <em>stint</em> me.”</p>

<p>“Just so she wouldn’t have to give you any more
money,” he suggested.</p>

<p>Madame Velasquez began to weep noisily. “What’ll
I do, Lieutenant—oh, what <em>will</em> I do?”</p>

<p>He continued to regard her through lazy eyes.</p>

<p>“Can’t you find somebody else to take her place?”
he said. “Somebody else to blackmail?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t young. It’s too <em>late</em>.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, Madame Velasquez.”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t. And unless it’s a case like Marge’s
was, such rackets take looks.”</p>

<p>“But surely such an intelligent and charming
woman as you, Madame Velasquez”—he unearthed
a trowel and laid it on pretty thick—“a woman of
the world, surely you can think up other cases where
the evidence or proof can be faked. You know very
well that you never had any real or visible proof
that Marge killed her husband in that canoe disaster,
now, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I did, too, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. If you really did, you’d have it with
you and would show it to me.”</p>

<p>She nibbled the bait slyly and refused it.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t, and I haven’t. And,” she said, “I
want proof of that trollop’s death. I’ll get it if I have
to drag the river myself.”</p>

<p>Madame Velasquez jumped up and ran nervously
to the door.</p>

<p>“Then you saw her drown herself, Madame
Velasquez?”</p>

<p>“I saw nothing, but I know—I know—what must
have been . . .”</p>

<p>She was out in the corridor and running for the
stairs—a velvet virago in blue. Lieutenant Valcour
ran out after her, and saw that Cassidy was blocking
her way.</p>

<p>“Ring up the wagon, Cassidy, and have her booked
as a material witness.”</p>

<p>Madame Velasquez began to screech. “Don’t
touch me. Keep your dirty hands off me.”</p>

<p>“Take her downstairs, Cassidy. After you’ve
arranged for the wagon leave her with O’Brian. Then
go up to the housekeeper’s room and ask Mrs. Siddons
if she’ll come down. I’ll see her in Endicott’s
room.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour slowly retraced his steps.
When he was again in Endicott’s room and the door
shut, he felt a strong recurrence of that annoying
sense of some hovering danger. He even shivered
a little as if at some draught of cold air and glanced
hastily at the windows.</p>

<p>But both were closed.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXVI. <br> 5:25 a. m.—There Was a Sailor</h2>

<p>Mrs. Siddons had not gone to bed at all. She
remained the same amazing pencil done in flat planes
of black that had left him standing with his ear pressed
against the panels of her bedroom door.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour was acutely interested in her
attitude toward Endicott’s body. Her glance, the
instant she entered the room, had flown to it surely
and accurately. There was no sorrow, no horror or
fear of the dead in that glance. It was wholly one of
triumph, the satisfied gazing of some revenge that
was removed from petty commonplaces. Mirrored
in its satisfaction were avenging hell fires, tormenting
presumably the black and wicked soul of what had
been a very black and wicked Endicott. After that
single initial glance she did not look toward the bed
again, but came over and sat with extraordinary
rigidity on the edge of a chair from where she could
stare out of the window at the clear morning light
of the winter’s day.</p>

<p>“Several hours ago, Mrs. Siddons,” Lieutenant
Valcour said abruptly, “you spoke with considerable
bitterness about Mr. Endicott’s attitude toward the
servants. I shan’t embarrass you by asking for any
information in detail. There are only one or two things
that I want to know—— Are you listening to me,
please?”</p>

<p>She dragged her eyes from the daylight, from the
white misty air from which she had been gathering
in her thoughts the happy flowers of a seed long
bedded in hate.</p>

<p>“I am listening,” she said.</p>

<p>“Then the first thing I want to know is this: was
there any one particular instance in which Mr.
Endicott’s actions toward one of the servants were
especially brutal or resented?”</p>

<p>The coals began to glow faintly beneath the ash
that dusted her eyes.</p>

<p>“There was one very particular instance,
Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Recently, Mrs. Siddons?”</p>

<p>“It occurred about a year ago, almost to a day.”</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Endicott attack her?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Here in the house?”</p>

<p>“No, Lieutenant. It happened on her afternoon
and evening out. Mr. Endicott’s car was parked
outside at the curb. He offered her a ride.”</p>

<p>“Where is this girl now, Mrs. Siddons?”</p>

<p>“She was committed last year to an institution
for the insane.”</p>

<p>The ash was completely gone now, and her eyes
blazed with avenging fires.</p>

<p>“But surely she brought charges, Mrs. Siddons?”</p>

<p>“She was insane when they found her, Lieutenant.
She was trying to die by throwing herself in front of
a motor in Central Park. She has never spoken lucidly
since.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour shrugged hopelessly. There it
was again: that wretched wave of hearsay showing its
baffling crest above the placid sea of established
fact. Rumour had had it that Marge Myles had killed
her husband; rumour now would have it about all
sorts of terrible implications concerning Endicott,
who was dead, and a girl who was confined in an insane
asylum. And neither, obviously, could give direct
testimony in accusation or defense.</p>

<p>“What was Mr. Endicott’s story?” he said.</p>

<p>“That he had driven her to Macy’s, where she
wanted to buy something, and had left her there.”</p>

<p>And why not? Undoubtedly Endicott had been
the blackest sort of a sheep, but the case was valueless
without a thousand illuminative lights, without a
whole medical history of the girl’s family, for
example.</p>

<p>“Did you know this girl fairly well, Mrs. Siddons?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It is my habit to know all of the girls in
my charge here very well. It is my duty, as I see it,
to act not only as a housekeeper, but as their
religious mentor and guide.”</p>

<p>“Then in the case of this girl, had she ever
previously shown any symptoms of being mentally
unbalanced?”</p>

<p>“There were times when I thought so, yes. Her
family, you see, was not free from the taint. Her
grandmother, on her mother’s side, had been insane.
That is what made Mr. Endicott’s actions so peculiarly
detestable, sir. She might have continued to live
a normal, useful, happy life had he not shocked her
so fatally.”</p>

<p>And on the other hand, Lieutenant Valcour decided,
Endicott need not necessarily have done anything
remotely of the sort. With such a direct strain
of insanity inherent in her blood no outside agency
whatever might have been needed to awaken it into
activity. And then, he reminded himself, the girl
had been shopping. He often wondered why more
women didn’t go mad while shopping.</p>

<p>“Had Mr. Endicott any alibi for the period
between the time he left her at Macy’s and came
home?”</p>

<p>“No, Lieutenant. He said he had driven out a ways
on Long Island along the Motor Parkway and then
had come back.”</p>

<p>“So nothing was done about the matter officially?”</p>

<p>“There was nothing to do.”</p>

<p>“Then the only substantiated fact in the story is
that she was seen getting into Mr. Endicott’s car in
front of this house. I suppose someone did see her?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Endicott saw her, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>There was distinct food for thought in that. No
matter how far flung the tangents in the case
appeared to be, they touched as a common circumference
the enveloping influence of Mrs. Endicott.</p>

<p>“Is this girl still confined at the institution, Mrs.
Siddons?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. There has been nothing
said—no communication.”</p>

<p>“What was the colour of her hair, Mrs. Siddons?”</p>

<p>“Black—the deepest, prettiest black I ever saw.
They say that opposites are attracted to one another,
and it was so in her case.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Her husband was a blond.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour caught his breath sharply.
It fitted surprisingly well—the motive—the
crime—the fact that the girl might have retained her
key to the servants’ entrance and her husband have
got hold of it. And her husband would readily enough
have believed the talk about his wife and Endicott—husbands
had a habit of doing just that. To the man’s
way of thinking, it wouldn’t have been anything so
ephemeral as a maternal grandmother who had
driven his wife insane: it would have been
Endicott.</p>

<p>Madame Velasquez’s innuendoes against the true
identity of anybody came back to Lieutenant
Valcour with annoying force. What about Hollander?
Hollander was a blond, and obviously of a different
level in education and position than the Endicotts.
And who had identified Hollander? Nobody. Endicott
and his wife were the only two in the house who could,
and Endicott was dead, and Mrs. Endicott had not
seen Hollander at all, if her unbelievable statement
were true: that she had not gone out onto the balcony
and along it to the window from where the shot had
been fired.</p>

<p>Suppose the man who had sat with Endicott had
just been posing as Hollander but had been, in reality,
the husband of this unfortunate girl. Suppose he had
been waiting outside for an opportunity to reënter
the house, had waylaid Hollander and forced his
errand from him, had taken his driver’s licence and
cards from him and had shown them to O’Brian at
the door to gain admittance. . . .</p>

<p>No—there still arose that fundamental question:
what had the attacker been searching for among
Endicott’s papers? This girl’s husband surely would
have nothing for which to search, unless it would be
for problematic evidence of his wife’s infidelity, and
that theory was pretty thin. . . .</p>

<p>“What became of this girl’s husband, Mrs.
Siddons?”</p>

<p>“He is a sailor on merchant vessels.” Her gesture
vaguely encompassed the Seven Seas. “Where he is,
or when, is as indeterminate as wind and tide.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour did not molest her extravagance.
He refrained from pointing out that few things
were determined quite so accurately, nowadays, as
the tides or, for the matter of that, the winds
themselves. He stood up.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Siddons.”</p>

<p>“Shall I go?”</p>

<p>“If you will be so kind. Later, perhaps, we will go
into greater details concerning this poor girl’s
husband.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Siddons feasted her eyes for one parting,
blinding instinct on the bed. She stopped at the
door and said, “You will never get them from me,
Lieutenant. And I am the only person who knows;
who even knows that she was married at all. She
confided in me, and if it was her husband who did
this thing you will never drag his name from my lips
even if my silence should mean——” Her eyes
became clouded and her thoughts confused. She
wanted to say something magnificent, something
splendidly fitting to the occasion which she
interpreted quite sincerely as a divine act on the part
of God, with that poor, frail little Maizie’s husband
as His instrument on earth. Even if her silence were to
mean what? The words wouldn’t form. They rattled
around in her tired head meaninglessly: bar of
justice—herself in the dock—oh, it was cruel—life was
cruel, and living was crueler still. Only death was
kind, sleep and peace beneath the shelter of His
sweet omnipotence. She stumbled a little as she
crossed the threshold and made her way, sobbing
futilely, back upstairs.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXVII. <br> 5:46 a. m.—Mrs. Endicott Cannot Be Found</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour stepped across the corridor
and rapped on the door of Mrs. Endicott’s room.
There was no response. He rapped again, and still
there was no response. He turned the knob and the
door swung inward.</p>

<p>The room was empty.</p>

<p>He closed the door and called to Cassidy, who was
at the other end of the corridor.</p>

<p>“Sir?” said Cassidy, when he had joined him.</p>

<p>“You’ve been out here all the while, haven’t you,
Cassidy?”</p>

<p>“Except when I went upstairs to get the
housekeeper, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, you did. Come inside here for a
minute with me. There are some questions I want to
ask you.”</p>

<p>They went into Endicott’s room.</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s good to see the daylight again,
Lieutenant. Will we be cleared up here soon?”</p>

<p>“I have a feeling that we’ll be finished pretty soon
now. Tell me, Cassidy, was it you or Hansen fired
first at Hollander?”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, Hansen and I have been disputing
that very point. We all but came to blows over it,
we did.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Because I claim it was him who fired the first
shot, and he still has the audacity to say it was me
who not only shot first, but shot two times before he
so much as pulled the trigger.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Lieutenant Valcour, “is exactly
what I wanted to know. You were both right and
both wrong.”</p>

<p>“Now, how can that be, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Neither of you fired the first shot, because it was
fired by the murderer over there at the window.
You heard it, and thought Hansen had fired. Hansen
heard it, and then heard your following shot, and
thought that you had fired twice.”</p>

<p>“That must have been it at that, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“It was. The second thing I wanted to ask you
about is Mrs. Endicott. She isn’t in her room.
Have you seen her about the corridor, or anywhere
else?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then go and look her up. Ask the men downstairs
if they’ve seen her, and if they haven’t, look through
the rooms on this floor and up above. When you do
come across her, ask her if she will please come in
here and see me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>Cassidy went out and closed the door.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour was beginning to feel very,
very tired. He yawned elaborately, stared out of the
window for a minute or two, and then sat down
again at the desk. There was something that he had
intended to do there when he had been interrupted by
the arrival of Madame Velasquez.</p>

<p>What was it?</p>

<p>It wasn’t connected with that wretched premonition
of danger which was nagging at him with increasing
insistence. But it was something just as
intangible . . .</p>

<p>Elusive as a shadow . . .</p>

<p>Yes, that was it—the thing that he had forgotten:
he had intended to trace to its source that faint
scent which was so curiously reminiscent of some
place—some thing. It had come, he remembered,
from the aperture from which he had taken the
drawer. He shoved a hand inside and felt around.
Wedged far in the back was a crumpled letter written
on heavy notepaper. He pulled it out, and the scent
became more penetrating.</p>

<p>It came back to him quite clearly now. It was the
same perfume that had drenched the note left by
Marge for Madame Velasquez up at the apartment.
He took the letter from its envelope, smoothed it,
and then turned to the signature. Yes, it was signed
“Marge.”</p>

<p>A knock on the hall door interrupted him, and
he placed the letter on the desk. Hansen came in.</p>

<p>“Yes, Hansen?”</p>

<p>“I have searched all the yards you told me to, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any gun, Lieutenant, that I could
see.”</p>

<p>“Did you look through all the shrubbery? There
are some evergreens down there that I noticed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I looked through and beneath every one
of them.”</p>

<p>“All right, Hansen.” Lieutenant Valcour studied
the young man facing him for a curious moment.
“You were at sea for a while, weren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I was with the navy during the war,
and after that on merchant ships for a year or two.”</p>

<p>“Would it be possible for a sailor to climb up onto
the balcony outside this window from the garden?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say offhand, Lieutenant. I didn’t
notice much about the balcony when I was down
there.”</p>

<p>“Then go down again and see what you think.
Let me know whether it would be an easy job,
difficult, or impossible.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Hansen went out, and Lieutenant Valcour had
barely returned his attention to the letter from Marge
Myles when there was another rapping on the door.
This time it was Cassidy who came in. Lieutenant
Valcour dropped the letter back upon the desk and
turned to him.</p>

<p>“Did you find Mrs. Endicott all right, Cassidy?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour felt strangely disturbed. He had
half expected Cassidy to answer in just that way; the
denial was nothing more than a fulfilment of the
curious premonitions he had been experiencing of
some subtle danger.</p>

<p>“Did you look in all the rooms?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Question anybody?”</p>

<p>“Everybody, Lieutenant. There’s no one has seen
hide nor hair of her.”</p>

<p>“How about the men at the doors?”</p>

<p>“Each one was at his post, sir. She didn’t go out.”</p>

<p>“Then in that case,” said Lieutenant Valcour,
“she must still be in.”</p>

<p>The thought was both a bromide and a consolation.
Nowadays, Lieutenant Valcour assured himself,
people didn’t vanish into thin air; it just wasn’t being
done. While concentrating in his mind as to the
possible whereabouts of the unfindable Mrs. Endicott,
his hands were mechanically placing the piles of
letters he had assorted back into the empty drawer.
He had shoved the letter from Marge Myles carefully
to one side. Any reading of it would have to
come later, after he had hit upon some logical
explanation for this sudden move on the part of Mrs.
Endicott.</p>

<p>“He must have been some stepper, Lieutenant,”
Cassidy said, eyeing with interest one disappearing
pack of pink envelopes.</p>

<p>“Quite a stepper, Cassidy.” . . . Where <em>could</em> she
hide? And why should she? . . .</p>

<p>“Each one of them piles from some dame?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Cassidy—each one from some
dame.” . . . She wanted to get out of the house, one
could be pretty sure of that, and go to the hospital to
see Hollander. But how could she have got past the
men at the doors? She couldn’t. . . .</p>

<p>“It certainly does beat hell what some guys
can get away with, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“But it never does beat hell, Cassidy.” . . . And
Hansen had been out around the backyards, even
supposing she had attempted anything so unbelievable
as to scale fences. That was absurd. . . .</p>

<p>“It ain’t all a matter of looks, exactly—no, nor
money, either.” Cassidy’s glance toward the bed
was but half complimentary. “I’ve run with lads
that was one step this side of being human monkeys,
but could they pick them? I’ll say. They had sex
appeal. How about it, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, Cassidy.” . . . As for the roof, it
was peaked and offered no passage to the roofs of
the adjoining houses. One couldn’t picture her, in
any case, scrambling over roofs any more than
one could believe that she would scramble over
fences. . . .</p>

<p>“And the worst of it is with these bimbos that have
it, they ain’t ever satisfied.”</p>

<p>“No one is ever satisfied, Cassidy.” . . . There
might be a way to the roof at that, from the attic . . .
attic . . .</p>

<p>“Not ever with anything, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Not really ever with anything.” . . . Attic . . .
and that curious look that one had had to interpret
as exaltation. It couldn’t be possible, but
still—— “Stay right here, Cassidy!”</p>

<p>Cassidy gave a nervous jump. The words were
sparks from flint striking steel. Lieutenant Valcour’s
sudden spurt of speed as he rushed toward the door
was surprising.</p>

<p>A possible solution to Mrs. Endicott’s absence
had just come to him with rather horrible clearness.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch28">

<h2>Chapter XXVIII. <br> 6:00 a. m.—Mist Drifting Through Mist</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour was out of the door in no
time and racing along the corridor up the stairs to
the floor above. Somewhere—somewhere was the
entrance to the stairs leading farther up to the attic.
Ah!—softly now, quietly, not to disturb or shock.
Thank God the treads were firm and didn’t creak. . . .</p>

<p>There was a window in the attic, at the garden
end of its peak, not a large window, but big enough
to permit the cold white light of morning to illumine
the place grayly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott’s back was toward him, her face
toward that window, and the light from it blurred
softly about her silhouette of darkness. She had
upended the trunk she was standing on, and it had
placed her hands within convenient reach of the rafter
about which she had fastened one end of a short
rope. Its other end was coiled in a running noose
about her neck.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour measured the distance between
where he stood at the top of the stairs and the trunk.
He could never make it. Some board would creak.
And yet, if he cried out, or spoke, if he failed in the
proper choice of a word—in fact, the least thing that
startled her would destroy her almost calm stance
of fatalistic poise.</p>

<p>He took a penknife from his pocket and, slitting
the laces of his shoes, removed them. Thank God
her back was toward him, and the window was there
with its square of light cut clearly in muffled
grays—its light with which she seemed to be holding some
private service of communion—that inevitable
farewell with earth indulged in by each wretched soul
before exchanging its conscious lonesomeness for the
obscure and problematic company of the damned. . . .</p>

<p>He was very near her now, himself a mist drifting
softly through mist. . . .</p>

<p>Whispering—whispering—he could hear her whispering—a
thin flow of meaning rather than of words,
sent from the grayness to that light beyond—sent
through a little measured casement out into the
immeasurable brilliance of eternity. Her hands were
resting easily by her side; her body relaxed more and
more peacefully in repose.</p>

<p>“. . . and if you’re there, Tom darling, and Herbert,
too . . .”</p>

<p>He could leap forward now and catch her if it were
necessary, but better be safe, quite safe.</p>

<p>“. . . it won’t be heaven, dear. They have no room
for such as you and me in heaven. But when you
come——”</p>

<p>His arms closed gently about her, and her body
seemed to stiffen into steel. She relaxed at once, and
then stared down at him incuriously. She removed
the noose from about her neck as casually as she
might have taken off a hat. He lifted her to the floor.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any hurry,” she said.</p>

<p>He knew that she was hinting definitely at the
future, when he and the law were finished with her
and she would be free to book her passage for eternity
again without supervision or restraint.</p>

<p>“No hurry, Mrs. Endicott; nor any need, now.”</p>

<p>The “now” dragged her sharply from the mists.
She stared at him with penetrating interest.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hollander,” he said, “will undoubtedly
recover.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>The word was clipped from some inner store of
ice.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that alter the surface of things, Mrs.
Endicott—of your intention?”</p>

<p>“Why should it, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry that you choose to continue evasive.”</p>

<p>“I’m not. It is you who see things, read things in
people that are never there.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t true, Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>“What is there further that you wish to know?”</p>

<p>There was no compromise, no yielding, and the
hardness in her voice was very definite. She looked
almost extravagantly capable, too, in the smart dark
dress she had put on. She was, Lieutenant Valcour
reflected, one of those rare women who always “look
their best” no matter what the time is or the situation;
who make a point of looking so even when quite
alone, and especially so, he added, when committing
suicide. But he was not deceived by her hardness.
There were invisible forces working within her,
still stirred into turmoil by that impressive emotional
ladder she must have so recently climbed in order
to arrive at the decision to take her own life. If he
were ever to understand this complex woman he felt
that he must do so now, while he and she stood where
they were in their private world—a tight little sphere
of shadows sifted with mists of sunlit dust—and
before they descended the attic stairs to the routined
environment of daily living. He decided to attempt
to lead her by certain matter-of-fact paths that would
end in quicksands.</p>

<p>“Why did you have the address of Marge Myles in
your directory, Mrs. Endicott?”</p>

<p>She answered with the mechanical patience of an
elder explaining some academic problem to a child.</p>

<p>“It was necessary to take her into account. As
I have already told you, she possessed a certain
standing—enough of a one to differentiate her from the
other women whom my husband picked up promiscuously—and
the time might have come when I felt it
advisable to get rid of her. Not murder—you’re too
intelligent to misunderstand me—there are several
ways one woman can get rid of another woman that
are just as effective.”</p>

<p>“Which one did you employ, Mrs. Endicott?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t especially nice, but I wasn’t dealing with
a nice woman. I employed forgery.”</p>

<p>This caught Lieutenant Valcour a little unprepared.</p>

<p>“Forgery?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I added a postscript to a letter Harry Myles
had sent me before he married Marge. Harry never
dated his letters. This one was harmless enough, but
there was a reference in it to the camp he owned by
that lake up in Maine. The postscript that I added
changed the whole character of the letter. It made it
apparent that Harry very definitely feared Marge
was planning to murder him. I gave that letter to
Herbert about a month ago, when it seemed that
his interest in Marge was becoming dangerously
serious.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he ask you why you hadn’t produced it
before?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I explained that I had just come across it
in an old letter file that hadn’t been gone through for
years. I asked him whether it was too late to do
anything about it—show the letter to some proper
authority, for instance. Of course I knew what he would
say.”</p>

<p>“That it was too late?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t he also ask you why you hadn’t said
something about the letter at the time of Harry
Myles’s death?”</p>

<p>“I pointed out that we were in Europe at that time
and didn’t hear the news until many months later,
when we got back. By then the letter had escaped
my mind.”</p>

<p>“And did your action influence your husband’s
feeling toward Marge Myles?”</p>

<p>“It was beginning to. Things like that work slowly;
they keep breeding in the mind until they become
effective.”</p>

<p>She had missed, he decided, her century. When
the Medicis were in flower she, too, would have
bloomed her best.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Endicott, what was your real reason for
sending for the police last night?”</p>

<p>“I can explain that better by accounting for my
movements between the time that Herbert knocked
on the door to say good-bye and you arrived. Will
that satisfy you?”</p>

<p>“I hope so, Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t lie to you, Lieutenant. I shall tell you
the exact truth. Roberts was in the room with me,
fixing some disorder in my dress. I left the room
shortly after and started down the corridor for
the sitting room. Mrs. Siddons, my housekeeper—I
don’t know whether you’ve met her or not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>“She was standing at the foot of the stairs leading
to the floor above. She said she had something to
tell me, and we went into the sitting room.”</p>

<p>“That was just after seven o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Five minutes—ten—yes. Mrs. Siddons brought
up the subject of a particularly despicable affair that
my husband was involved in with one of our maids
over a year ago. Shall I go into it?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t necessary, Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>“The maid was married. Her husband was a
sailor.” Mrs. Endicott paused for a moment, and
seemed to be sorting in her mind which facts she
cared to present and which, in spite of her recent
avowal of candour, she preferred to hold in reserve.
“You have probably noticed, Lieutenant, that Mrs.
Siddons is an abnormal woman. She is the most striking
example of the religious-fanatic type that I have
ever met. Her life is literally built upon the composite
foundation of faith and duty which she believes all
mankind owes to God. Her belief in direct punishment
visited by God on earthly sinners is a fixed idea. And
last night in my sitting room she told me that God
was going to strike my husband and that His
instrument would be the husband of that maid whom
Herbert had injured.”</p>

<p>“But if that was an act which she so obviously
desired to see consummated, Mrs. Endicott, why
did she warn you—anybody—about it in advance?”</p>

<p>“Religious fanatics, Lieutenant, scorn the idea
that human agency can interfere with the workings
of any divine plan. Things, for them, are ordained
and are supposed to happen just exactly as they are
ordained.”</p>

<p>“But why did she warn you?”</p>

<p>“She came to tell me about it, she said, in order
that I might be prepared for the shock. She has
always sympathized inordinately with me over what
she terms Herbert’s ungodly actions. I asked her,
naturally, to be more explicit, and I finally forced
the admission from her that she had seen, or else
believed that she had seen, the maid’s husband that
afternoon loitering about the street in front of the
house. She went upstairs, then, to her own quarters.
It seemed absurd.”</p>

<p>“Then it began to prey upon you?”</p>

<p>“Indirectly.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“In its possible relation to something else.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour became intuitive.</p>

<p>“You are wondering now,” he said, “whether or
not you ought to tell me all about the tea.”</p>

<p>“How did you establish the connection?”</p>

<p>“Between your having tea with Mr. Hollander
yesterday afternoon and Mrs. Siddons’s story?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It’s rather simple, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Endicott, I think it is. You won’t
deny, will you, that you very definitely impressed on
Mr. Hollander that your determination to ‘end it all’
either by committing suicide or killing your husband
was sincere? Mr. Hollander <em>was</em> the confidant for
your secret confusions, sort of a proving ground for
reactions. I’ve already substantiated that theory,
both through Mr. Hollander himself and his friend.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t deny it.”</p>

<p>“And you believed that he would do something to
prevent you from accomplishing your purpose.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I did.”</p>

<p>“And in your naturally upset state of mind last
evening Mrs. Siddons’s curious prophecy concerning
the maid’s husband taking his revenge made more of
a genuine impression upon you than you cared to
admit. You were subconsciously afraid that something
<em>would</em> happen—that the sailor might really injure
or kill your husband, and that Mr. Hollander,
when the police investigated, would somehow become
involved. There was even a possibility that worshipping
you as he does, when he heard of your husband’s
murder he might give himself up to the police and
offer a false confession in order to shield you. It has
often been done, you know.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Lieutenant. I did think exactly
that. The muddle of the whole thing began to drive
me crazy during dinner. I went down at seven-thirty
and ate nothing. I don’t think I stayed at the table
for more than five minutes. I went upstairs and into
Herbert’s room, looking for something. I really don’t
know what—unless it was for some sort of physical
confirmation of his aliveness by the things he owned.
Then I saw that note on his desk. I hadn’t the shred
of a nerve left by then, and the note genuinely
worried me. It was such a direct confirmation of Mrs.
Siddons’s story. I wasn’t exactly panicky, but I felt
as if things had got out of hand. I tried to reach Mr.
Hollander by telephone, but he wasn’t in his apartment.
I began to picture converging forces: himself—the
maid’s husband—and Herbert as a focal point.
I felt that something had to be done. Well, I
telephoned the police.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me about the maid and
her husband when I came, Mrs. Endicott?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t the sort of thing one would plunge into
directly.”</p>

<p>“You would have told me in time, then?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“And why,” he asked quietly, “did you try to
direct my suspicions against Marge Myles when, in
view of your special knowledge, that maid’s husband
was the logical suspect? That’s a little inconsistent,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>She looked at him evenly.</p>

<p>“Do you always do precisely the proper thing at
the proper moment?”</p>

<p>“Rarely ever, Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>“Well, neither do I. I don’t think anybody does.”</p>

<p>She adopted again that patient, explanatory precision
of the teacher. “A person’s actions or statements
during any moment of great strain are dominated
by that moment itself, rather than being any
sane reflection of logical and contributory causes.
At such times one clings to straws.”</p>

<p>“Marge Myles was a straw?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott shrugged. “Herbert had gone,
as I supposed, to see her. I believed that whatever
happened to him would occur between this house and
her apartment, or at some moment during the evening
while they were together. I’m not claiming that
there was any sense to my beliefs. I wasn’t feeling
exactly sensible just then.”</p>

<p>“And you would have been quite willing to have
Marge Myles blamed for anything that happened
rather than either the sailor or Mr. Hollander?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite.”</p>

<p>It was very convincing—her willingness, that is.
As for her credibility, Lieutenant Valcour retained
reservations. He started along another divergence.</p>

<p>“Why have you kept Roberts so long in your employ,
Mrs. Endicott, when you must have known how
deeply she hates you?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott smiled with frank amusement.</p>

<p>“You’ve never kept a maid, have you,
Lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Hardly.”</p>

<p>“Then you can’t appreciate fully what I mean
when I say that Roberts is a good maid. What earthly
difference does it make whether she hates or loves
me? I’m hiring her services, not her emotions, and
her services are excellent. I’ve frequently wished that
someone in my successive chain of cooks would
develop a similar passion. There’s something so
binding about it.”</p>

<p>He felt that she was escaping him again, that her
armour was swiftly undergoing repair. In the brightening
light her face shone clearer. She didn’t seem quite
such an enigma, after all. Nothing ever was, he
reflected, truly enigmatic in daytime. It was just a
tired face, wearied by any number of things other
than the lack of sleep.</p>

<p>“I wish you would trust me, Mrs. Endicott,”
he said. “I’m not a bad sort, really, and I’m not
trying to trap you into admissions that would prove
injurious to yourself. There are still confusions that
have to be straightened out. I have been assured by
Mr. Hollander that you were devoted to your husband.
You personally imply that your interest in Mr.
Hollander is purely that of a friend, and yet you
address him in your notes as ‘Tom, darling.’ And there
isn’t any question but that he worships you. The
situation doesn’t fall under the heading of the eternal
triangle. It’s a hub, rather, from which radiate
several broken and uneven spokes.”</p>

<p>“Broken spokes.” The phrase appealed to her
in a tragic sense inordinately out of keeping with its
flavour of triteness. But then—he had said so to her
before, ages ago—the trite things were the true
things. And that’s just what Tom and Herbert and
herself were. And the hub? Passion, she supposed, or
perhaps a composite illusion of all the various
derivatives of love.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to resolve human feelings into the
simplicity of A B C’s,” she said. “I can’t just say I
loved Herbert because I was married to him and because
he was the first person I ever loved, or that no
matter how many other people there may be later
in my life I will always return to him in my heart,
just because he <em>was</em> the first person whom I loved,
and expect you to understand.” She brushed with
elementary strokes through fog in her effort to be
explicit. “I love Tom Hollander, too, just as much as
I loved Herbert. It isn’t nice, but it’s the truth. Love
isn’t a unit, a single emotion tightly wrapped up in
one word. It’s a hundred feelings and desires and
any number of little human hurts that are longing to
be made well again.” A certain bitterness crept into
her manner: a bitterness of revolt. “The whole
wretched business is too stylized. It’s quite all right
to love your father and your mother equally; in fact,
it’s held wrong not to—exactly fifty per cent. of
your parental love must go to each. Brotherly love
must also be reduced to proportionate fractions. The
love for one’s neighbours is presumably scattered into
legion. But if a woman announced that this otherwise
divisible quality is spent upon more than one
single man——”</p>

<p>Her laughter wasn’t very pleasant to hear. Lieutenant
Valcour felt a little upset; there was something
disturbingly reasonable in her attitude. Was it
pure sophistry? Not really. There was a strong
element of fact and truth running through it all. It
was useless to parade before her the different <i>clichés</i>
of what any universal acceptance of her implied
philosophy would do to society. He imagined rather
accurately the treatment she would hand out to
them. And like most people who had got what they
wanted, he didn’t know even faintly what to do with
it. He couldn’t come out flatly and ask her if she was
planning to marry Hollander, and apart from the
insight it gave him into her character there hadn’t
been any special advancement toward a definite
solution of the problem of who <em>did</em> kill her husband,
and for what motive. Lieutenant Valcour began to
feel that it was he who had landed in the quicksands
rather than herself.</p>

<p>“You have been very patient with me, Mrs. Endicott,
and very kind. To an extent I am beginning to
understand you. We have arrived again, but perhaps
with a surer footing this time, at our stumbling
block. Before we attack it, I wonder if you cannot
think of any reason why your husband should have
joined you up here in the attic when he found you
here yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott was still too drugged with abstracts
to attend very kindly to the mechanics of detailed
fact.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “it wasn’t to commit suicide.
That leaves your other nine tenths, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You mean that he must have been just looking
for something?”</p>

<p>“There’s hardly any other plausible explanation.”</p>

<p>“But does he keep things up here?”</p>

<p>“He may have. This is his trunk.”</p>

<p>She moved off toward the window, disinterested
in anything further that he might care to do. A complete
lassitude drenched her, and she sunned it negligently
in the light sifting down through dusty panes.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour righted the upended trunk and
raised its lid. There were some papers lying loosely
in its upper tray. He studied them curiously until he
came across a certain one that caused him to draw
his breath in sharply. He folded the paper and put
it in his pocket. Then he closed the trunk. His
manner, as he approached Mrs. Endicott, was implacably
stern.</p>

<p>“I want you to tell me,” he said, “just where
about this house you have hidden Marge Myles.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch29">

<h2>Chapter XXIX. <br> 6:30 a. m.—As Is Mirage</h2>

<p>Mrs. Endicott stared sharply at Lieutenant
Valcour. She was suddenly tensely alert.</p>

<p>“I think,” she said, “that you have gone mad.”</p>

<p>“Do you still maintain the pretence that when
you were on the sill of your window and looking
toward your husband’s room you saw nobody on the
balcony?”</p>

<p>“There is no reason why I should alter the truth.”</p>

<p>“I shall be as patient with you, Mrs. Endicott, as
you have just been with me. Listen carefully to me,
please, and I will tell you why it is I believe Marge
Myles killed your husband, and why I think you
have given her sanctuary after the crime by
concealing her some place within this house.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no alternative but to listen, Lieutenant.
But you are wrong—absurdly wrong.”</p>

<p>“We will start with the initial premise, Mrs.
Endicott, that Marge <em>did</em> murder Harry Myles in that
canoe episode on the lake. I know that she has been
paying blackmail to her stepmother, Madame Velasquez,
for a long while, probably since the time of the
crime itself. Well, a woman of her type doesn’t pay
hush money easily; she makes very certain, first, that
the blackmailer really has the goods on her. Which
made it simple for your husband.”</p>

<p>“Herbert? Are you suggesting the fantastic idea
that Herbert was trying to blackmail her?”</p>

<p>“People are blackmailed into giving up more things
than money, Mrs. Endicott. I’m not suggesting that
your husband was after money, but I do suggest that
to further some abortive purpose Mr. Endicott held
the postscript forgery that you made over Marge
Myles’s head as a threat. I have just found that letter
in his trunk, and it is now in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“Abortive purpose—— Don’t go on just for a
moment, please—I’m trying to make it fit.”</p>

<p>“It’s something along the lines of cruelty that I’m
suggesting—some special cruelty.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Herbert liked to see things squirm. He
was subconsciously sadistic.”</p>

<p>“He probably drove her pretty far, because she
made up her mind to get that letter—he undoubtedly
greatly magnified its importance as evidence to
her—no matter at what risk to herself. I don’t really
believe that when she came here last night she had any
intention at all of actually killing your husband.
What she wanted was that letter. Did you let her
into the house, Mrs. Endicott?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott smiled a bit acidly and kept her lips
tightly compressed.</p>

<p>“Because if you didn’t,” Lieutenant Valcour went
on, “she must have stolen a key from your husband.
At any rate, she was in the house here and searching
for the letter in Mr. Endicott’s room sometime
around seven last night. Mr. Endicott should have
been miles away up at her apartment, according to
appointment, and leaving her a clear field. She had
planned the whole thing out pretty carefully, because
she left a note for Madame Velasquez, who was due
to arrive at the apartment for a visit last night.
Marge implied in the note that it had been written
after seven when, as a matter of fact, it must have
been written considerably earlier and planted in the
apartment either as an alibi or as an explanation to
Mr. Endicott of her absence. It would certainly have
sent him hurrying off to the Colonial in search of her.
It wasn’t successful, of course, as he was undoubtedly
delayed because of the quarrel he had with you, and
was here in the house instead of up at her apartment
as she had expected he would be. Don’t you see that
it rather all fits in?”</p>

<p>“Quite. But I still fail to understand what possible
connection it can have with me.”</p>

<p>“It has every connection with you, Mrs. Endicott,
because unless we can prove that Marge Myles fired
the shot this morning that killed your husband it will
be unpleasantly necessary to establish the charge
against yourself.”</p>

<p>“I am probably very stupid, Lieutenant, but it is
incomprehensible to me why I should shoot my
husband around two or three o’clock this morning
because Marge Myles was searching for a letter in his
room at seven last night.”</p>

<p>“Consider the problem, please, as two separate
crimes and follow it through on that basis. At seven
o’clock last night we have Marge Myles searching
the pockets of your husband’s clothes in his cupboard.
He comes into the room, and she finds herself
trapped in the cupboard. He opens the door, and the
sudden terrifying sight of her gives him a heart attack.
She believes him dead and drags him into the cupboard
so that his body will not be found until she has
had a chance to escape. She hasn’t returned to her
apartment, you know, all night, so it’s quite possible
she has either taken flight or is in hiding some place
in the city.”</p>

<p>“Then I can’t, as you have suggested, be hiding
her in the house.”</p>

<p>It was Lieutenant Valcour who now assumed the
rôle of teacher, with Mrs. Endicott as his young
pupil.</p>

<p>“Not under that supposition. But if she did escape
from the house at that time, what have we left? You
found the scrap of paper on which she herself wrote
a hinted threat in an effort to divert suspicion, and
the writing of which was inspired by the distraught
mental condition she must have been in. You called
the police, and we found Mr. Endicott. Your
suspicions jumped unerringly to the man who was
uppermost in your thoughts: Mr. Hollander. He, you said
to yourself, had done this thing to save you.
Consequently, when you learned that Mr. Endicott had
been revived and was expected to make a statement,
you shot him to prevent his accusing Mr. Hollander,
and you arranged your alibi with considerable
ingenuity by only pretending to have taken the
narcotic.”</p>

<p>“It makes quite a case, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Endicott, quite a case.”</p>

<p>“And the alternative? You did suggest that there
was an alternative.”</p>

<p>“That Marge Myles has never left the house at
all. That she is still here. And this is what the
prosecuting attorney will offer to the jury: that with your
knowledge she got onto the balcony through one of
the windows in your room, shot Mr. Endicott,
returned to your room, and was hidden by you some
place around this house.”</p>

<p>“All of which is unfortunately negatived, Lieutenant,
by the fact that it was my slipper you found
outside the window, and not hers.”</p>

<p>“The prosecuting attorney can alter the action of
the scene to suit that, Mrs. Endicott. After Marge
Myles got onto the balcony you were terrified at the
thought of what you had become a party to. You
made an effort to recall her, when the shots were
fired and threw you into a panic. You dropped your
slipper and got back into the room.” Lieutenant
Valcour became quietly persuasive. “Which of my two
theories shall I believe? I can make you no promises,
Mrs. Endicott, because any confession that has been
given under an understanding that there will be an
amelioration of punishment loses value in court. But
I can suggest to you that if you choose to make things
easier for justice the act may prove beneficial for
yourself. There are more unwritten laws than the
common one so generally known.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott looked at him queerly.</p>

<p>“You don’t worry me,” she said, “at all. Any
course that I might take can have but a common, a
desired ending. The method of achievement is utterly
inconsequential to me, as long as the ultimate result
remains the same.”</p>

<p>She was mounted again, Lieutenant Valcour decided,
upon her hobby which carried her along indifferent
trails to death. The apparent strength of
her obsession rendered any further efforts on his part
futile. In the attic there was, for him, no longer
anything of mystery or the beauty of shrouded things.
It was an ugly, littered room peopled by a smartly
turned out beauty who, like a petulant and spoiled
child reaching for the moon, sought further mysteries
in that life which beckons from beyond life, and by a
tired, oldish fellow standing stupidly in his stockinged
feet away from his shoes.</p>

<p>“Come downstairs with me, Mrs. Endicott,” he
said. “As soon as my men have thoroughly searched
this house you will be formally charged.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch30">

<h2>Chapter XXX. <br> 7:11 a. m.—The Criminal and Weapon of the Crime</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour was once more in his shoes.
Even in their laceless condition they restored his
confidence in the relative fitness of things.</p>

<p>Mrs. Endicott preceded him down two flights of
stairs and to the door of her husband’s room, which
Lieutenant Valcour opened. He looked inside and
saw Cassidy sound asleep, seated on the large
mahogany chest by the window. And he did not blame
Cassidy so much as he envied him.</p>

<p>“Cassidy.”</p>

<p>Cassidy’s sharp return to consciousness would have
reflected credit upon the hero of any Western drama.</p>

<p>“Sir?”</p>

<p>“Put your gun back, Cassidy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lieutenant. I must have dropped off for a
cat nap.”</p>

<p>“We can discuss that later. I want you to take
Mrs. Endicott down to the entrance hall with you
and leave her there in charge of O’Brian. She is under
arrest.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“After that, warn the men on the servants’ entrance
and garden door to keep on their toes. If anyone
tries to get past them on any pretext whatever
they are to stop him. Look up Hansen—he may still
be in the backyard—and then both of you come
back here. We will then search the house.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour went into Endicott’s room and
closed the door. It was getting to be a mechanical
action with him that caused him to go to the desk
and sit down. The perfumed sheet of notepaper,
which he had twice been prevented through interruptions
from reading, caught his attention at once.
He read the letter through.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>I don’t believe you [it began, without any preliminaries], and
  right from the start I tell you I think you are a liar and a louse.
  Harry never wrote your wife no such thing, and even if he did it
  proves nothing anyway. Nobody can prove a <em>thing</em>. You think it
  is funny to scare me and if you do it any more I am going to show
  you just how damn funny it is. I am through with you just the
  same way that your wife is through with you and you are a nasty
  rat.</p>

  <p class="signature">Marge.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not really, Lieutenant Valcour decided, an essentially
nice person. He folded the letter and put it in
his pocket to keep company with the postscript forged
by Mrs. Endicott. It would serve ably in establishing
a motive and help the prosecuting attorney to clinch
the case. Just as soon, he added unhappily, as he had
unearthed the criminal and the weapon of the crime.
That criminal, he repeated softly to himself, who
with her weapon was still at large about the house,
unless his theory of the case was basically wrong.</p>

<p>And therein lay the danger, the source of that
curious presentiment of impending menace which
had gripped him at odd intervals throughout the
night. Strange that it should possess him most
strongly in this silent room. But wasn’t that just
the association of ideas? Endicott, dead on the bed
over there, and the path of that death-dealing bullet
cutting through that corner over by the other window.
He sought relief from a return of it by a mental
mopping up. It didn’t do to linger on
presentiments. . . .</p>

<p>There were those few little side issues to think
about; issues that had puzzled him, but which did
not bear any direct reference to the main theme.
He felt that they were explainable without any
further personal investigation.</p>

<p>It seemed obvious to him, for example, that the
reason why Mrs. Siddons had gone downstairs with
her bonnet on, when the sight of O’Brian by the front
door had turned her back, was a desire on her part
to get in touch with Maizie’s sailor husband and warn
him that the crime she thought he had committed
had been discovered and that the police were in the
house. She had told Mrs. Endicott that she believed
that she had seen him loitering about the street
during the afternoon. And Mrs. Siddons would never
have questioned her own ability to walk right out
and find him because, if it so desired, Providence
would have prearranged a suitable rendezvous.</p>

<p>. . . They came from that corner, really: those
definitely significant waves of warning, as insistent as
the scent that had led him to find the letter from
Marge Myles in the desk. But they weren’t a scent,
nor were they anything so definite as a letter. They
were (the astonishing thought thrilled him
disagreeably) <em>Marge Myles</em>—her
personality—herself—inimical. . . . Nonsense, nonsense—the room was
empty. . . .</p>

<p>He forced himself to think of the two little
bewilderments that had troubled him in connection with
the thoroughly bewildering Roberts. That pregnant
look she had given him—what had it really meant,
more or less, than an intense urge on her part to erase
any spell of fascination which Mrs. Endicott might
have cast upon him, and to plant in its place the seeds
of suspicion of Roberts’s own sowing. It had been
nothing more, really, than that.</p>

<p>Now of greater inconsistency had been Roberts’s
suggestion of Hollander as the proper friend to stay
with Endicott; for Roberts assuredly had held a
fantastic passion for Endicott—fantastic in that there
was this abnormal interrelationship of his personality
with that of her war-killed brother—and she had just
as assuredly been convinced that a liaison existed
between Hollander and Endicott’s wife. There was
but one solution: Roberts had never observed
Hollander and Mrs. Endicott together, and she had
hoped, should morning bring a meeting, that under
the natural dramatic effect of the setting there might
be some betrayal. A look, perhaps, was all she wanted
to confirm her suspicions. And there could have been
in her mind no thought of any real danger to Endicott
from Hollander, for had there not been a nurse and
two policemen close by on guard? Then later, when
Endicott was well again, Roberts could have told
him the thing which she had seen.</p>

<p>. . . Mental fingers, that’s what they were,
plucking at his nerves and forming dissonances that
chilled him queerly. He <em>wasn’t</em> alone—but he must
be—the room was empty. . . .</p>

<p>He would think of that Mr. “Smith” who lived
with Hollander. Did he fit in—beyond one solid
thump on the head? Only as one of the myriad side
issues that cling like parasites to the trunk of each
major crime. One could suppose (with reasonable
assurance that the supposition would later prove to
be fact) that Hollander was in some genteelly illicit
profession such as bootlegging, and that Mr. Smith
drummed up Hollander’s customers for him among
the night clubs—incidentally relieving some of the
more foolish of them of their jewels. Mr. Smith might
well have believed, at that moment when Lieutenant
Valcour went to the telephone in their apartment,
that if Hollander’s goose was cooked his own might
be cooked, too, and a blackjack had then seemed the
simplest expedient that would insure his fading
swiftly out of the picture.</p>

<p>. . . The room was empty—the room was empty. . . .</p>

<p>As for the emotional jungle of warped and sunless
growths through which Endicott, his wife, Marge
Myles, and Hollander had all groped their
illusion-drugged way to this unhappy end—that lay beyond
the punishment or acquittal of earthbound law. The
proper tribunal for that must be found seated within
their separate souls. Lies—evasions—fetid depths . . .</p>

<p>But <em>had</em> she lied?</p>

<p>Had there truly been no one on the balcony, as
Mrs. Endicott had said?</p>

<p>The shot had assuredly been fired from the direction
of that window above the large mahogany chest.</p>

<p>Above?</p>

<p>Presentiments were banished before the lash of
fact. The lid of that chest was <em>not quite closed</em>. And
the object that was holding it open, for the space of
perhaps a half of an inch, was the small black muzzle
of a gun.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour’s hand moved indolently toward
the upper left pocket of his vest, in which there
rested a flat, efficient little automatic of small calibre.
He knew what had happened—that owing to his
stillness for the last five minutes the murderer had
thought the room was empty and was attempting to
escape. His hand moved more quickly, but not
quickly enough. The lid opened wider—eyes—a face—a
little shock of alarm, of terror—all ever so much
more quickly accomplished than told. The lid
slammed up.</p>

<p>“Quit it, Lieutenant, and put your hands down flat
on the top of that desk.”</p>

<p>“You’re Marge Myles, of course,” he said.</p>

<p>He flattened his hands on the desk’s mahogany
surface and stared curiously at her sultry beauty as
she sat on the rim of the open chest. Flamboyant,
that’s what she was, and terribly bizarre from the
effect of a shingled ripple of bleached blonde hair
above her Spanish night-filled eyes.</p>

<p>“You have put yourself in my way, Lieutenant”—her
voice was as disagreeable as the clash of dishes
in a cheap restaurant—“and I am going to kill you
and escape.”</p>

<p>“I see,” Lieutenant Valcour said politely, “that
you believe in threes.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Your husband, Mrs. Endicott’s husband, and
now myself. One—two—three. For the sake of
symmetry it is a pity that I am a bachelor.”</p>

<p>She enjoyed for a full moment of silence—luxuriated
in it, really—the sense of power which she held
over this man. She had always enjoyed the power
exerted by her body, and it was refreshing to drink
quietly for a while of this different sort of power,
which, through the medium of the pistol held
unwaveringly in her hand, controlled the services of
life and death. She would shoot him soon. . . .</p>

<p>Lieutenant Valcour hoped that Hansen would not
blunder.</p>

<p>He could see Hansen quite clearly now, all but
pressed against the outside of the window just behind
Marge Myles. So Hansen, he reflected, had found that
there <em>was</em> a way to climb up onto the balcony from the
garden down below. What a handy thing it was, at
times, to have been a sailor. Lieutenant Valcour
fervently hoped that—the usefulness of the rule
having been accomplished—Hansen would promptly
stop being a sailor and become a policeman. He
couldn’t, and didn’t, expect that Hansen would shoot
a woman down in cold blood, nor would Hansen
dare to startle her by throwing open the window or
crashing through its glass. Could Hansen shoot
through the glass and knock the pistol from her hand?
Maybe once, Lieutenant Valcour thought unhappily,
out of every twenty times. And she certainly wouldn’t
refrain from pulling the trigger while Hansen
practised twenty times.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he said, “how you ever managed to
breathe inside of that chest.”</p>

<p>“The back of it is broken.” The casualness of the
question had startled her into an answer.</p>

<p>“Your own back must be pretty well broken, too.”
Was Hansen, the idiot, going to smash the glass after
all with the butt of his gun? Hansen was staring very
intently at him, seeking advice. He all but imperceptibly
shook his head in negation. “And what did you
have in the paper bag you carried when you came here
and from which you tore that scrap of paper upon
which you wrote the misleading note?”</p>

<p>“This gun.”</p>

<p>“You carried the gun in a paper bag?”</p>

<p>“I was smart, was I not? Who would think that in
a cheap paper bag there was a gun?”</p>

<p>“Not even a disciple of the fourth dimension.”
Hansen was aiming now at her wrist. It was absurd—he
faintly shook his head again. No—no! “How did
it happen that Mr. Endicott had his overcoat on but
you had his hat?”</p>

<p>“I wear it for a better disguise. I have the dust on
my face—there is the hat—it fits well over my cloche.
The effect is astonishing.”</p>

<p>“I see, and so when Endicott came back into the
room to get it he couldn’t find it and thought he must
have left it in the cupboard?”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes—you are a smart man, too.”</p>

<p>“And you entered the house with a duplicate key
which you had had made from one of Endicott’s?”</p>

<p>“Dear heaven, yes—how else?”</p>

<p>It did not please her that her climax should come at
a commonplace moment, when inconsequential questions
were being asked and equally inconsequential
answers being given. It was not bravura: the man
was genuinely unafraid. And she wanted him to be
afraid. One shouldn’t just dribble from the world:
there should be a blaze, a scene.</p>

<p>Then Hansen rapped, quite gently, upon the panes.</p>

<p>Inspiration? Genius? Perhaps. Lieutenant Valcour’s
Gallic blood swept back to the nation of its
source and he could have kissed that dear, that
brilliant Hansen upon both of his ruddy, his intelligent,
his Nordic cheeks.</p>

<p>She whirled as if something had flicked her. Blue
serge—brass buttons—a glinting shield. She pulled
the trigger.</p>

<p>But the muzzle of the gun was in her mouth.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXXI. <br> 8:37 p. m.—Five Years Later</h2>

<p>Mrs. Hollander thought for a moment of simply
dialling the operator and saying, “I want a
policeman.”</p>

<p>It was what the printed notices in the telephone
directory urged one to do in case of an emergency.
But it wasn’t an emergency exactly, nor—still
exactly—was it a policeman she wanted. She wanted a
detective, or an inspector, or something; a man to
whom she could explain her worry about Thomas,
and who could do something about it if he agreed with
her that Thomas was in danger.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hollander wanted most of all a man like
Lieutenant Valcour, who had so ably handled that
wretched affair five years ago when she had been
married to Herbert and Herbert had been shot. She
wondered whether Lieutenant Valcour was still on
the force, and decided to find out. She dialled Spring
3100. She grew nervous while waiting.</p>

<p>“This is Mrs. Thomas Hollander speaking,” she
said, when the same type of impersonal, efficient
voice answered her as had been the one five years
before. “I am ’phoning to inquire whether a Lieutenant
Valcour is still connected with the police force. . . .
I beg your pardon? Oh.” She gave the address
of her apartment house on Park Avenue.</p>

<p>“This is Mrs. Thomas Hollander speaking,”
she began again upon a second voice saying, “Hello!”
“and I am trying to get in touch with a Lieutenant
Valcour who—— I beg your pardon? . . . You <em>are</em>
Lieutenant Valcour—Inspector, is it? But how
perfectly efficient! I am worried, Inspector, about Mr.
Hollander, and I wonder whether it would be possible
for you to come up and talk it over with me. . . . No,
he hasn’t disappeared. I know exactly where he has
gone, but I have reason to believe that something
might happen to him. . . . Yes, I am the Mrs.
Hollander who was formerly Mrs. Herbert Endicott. . . .
Yes, that dreadful affair. . . . Oh, you will? Thank
you so much.”</p>

<p>Inspector Valcour smiled a curiously satisfied little
smile all to himself as he sat in a department
limousine, chauffeured by a department driver, and sped
smoothly north along Lafayette Street on the way to
Mrs. Hollander’s address on Park Avenue.</p>

<p>And he thought of many things.</p>

<p>He thought of Marge Myles and of Herbert Endicott,
who were dead; and of Madame Velasquez who,
too, had died.</p>

<p>He thought of Mrs. Siddons, returned to her native
New England hills, sinking her body and her being
into their granite harshnesses and drawing amazing
sustenance from them, as a flower will that grows in
the imperceptible fissure of some solid rock.</p>

<p>He thought of Roberts whom he had never seen
again and of whom he had never again heard, after
the violation of the Sullivan Law had been charged
against her, and her sentence suspended. She had
gone back to England, probably, to lapse into a
proper background for her neurotic broodings.</p>

<p>And that partner of Hollander’s—the Southernistic
Mr. Smith. He had faded entirely, never to return;
nor was the fact of any consequence at all. He had
been at best a side issue too unimportant for further
bother.</p>

<p>But most of all he thought of Mrs. Endicott, who
was now Mrs. Hollander.</p>

<p>The annals of history and the annals of crime were
fringed with women just like her: beautiful,
astonishing women, who revolved with their uncertainties
like satellites about the world of normal beings, trailing
their baleful, striking brilliance like an impalpable
poisonous gas across the surface of every person
whom they plucked and tortured within the intricate
enigma of their hearts. The law never could touch
her—nor could a person, either. She would escape.
She would always escape, with the subtlety of
mercury slipping between impotent fingers.</p>

<p>For she <em>had</em> escaped.</p>

<p>There wasn’t any doubt in his mind about that.
She had been the focal point five years ago in that
Endicott case, no matter what the law or men might
say. Her forgery of that postscript had had a deeper,
a more deliberate intention than the mere breaking up
of any affair between her husband and Marge Myles:
it was to have been a breaking up of all of his affairs.
Of him.</p>

<p>She was the true murderer of her husband, and
not Marge Myles. She had simply spread the powder
train to a suitably lethal explosive and had then
applied the match. The movements of the others had
been nothing more than gyrations performed by
stringed puppets. And she had held the strings. Some
of her puppets had died, committed suicide, and been
killed. And it didn’t matter in the least. The world
was ageless, she herself was ageless, and plenty of
puppets grew perennially every spring.</p>

<p>Inspector Valcour wondered, as he descended to
the curb and prepared to enter the lift to her
apartment, whether Thomas had become a puppet, too.</p>
